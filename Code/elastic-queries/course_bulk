The General Relativity and Quantum Fields Theory build on the content of PHYS3001. Half of the course develops General Relativity. This is the accepted theory of gravity and is one of the major triumphs of theoretical physics. The full geometric structure underpinning the theory will be developed, leading to the Einstein Field equation and an in depth study of the Schwarzschild black hole. The other half of the course will examine relativistic quantum field theory, which is arguably the most far-reaching attempt to combine special relativity and quantum physics in a unique framework. We explain in this part of the course the origin of particles (why are all electrons identical?), forces (why same charge repel while gravitation is attractive?) and antiparticles. The Feynman path integral formalism is used, leading to Klein-Gordon, Maxwell and Dirac equations.

From prehistoric times, human populations needed to understand animals' and plants' ethology, characteristics and distribution to obtain the necessary resources (for nutritional and non-nutritional purposes) to survive in a changing and harsh environment. After the Neolithic revolution, the domestication of plants and animals changed the way humans interacted with their environments, as well as leading to changes in animal and plant physiology. The interpretation of these processes is an interdisciplinary field which includes not only subjects as osteology, genetics and environmental studies but it also comprises some non-tangible aspects such as religion and iconography.

The framework focuses on institutional environments (such as legal systems) in different countries and their impacts on corporate behaviour.

The course deals primarily with the economic determinants of each country's growth, but the role of cultural, political and religious factors, as well as the ethnic diversity within China and India, will be taken into account in explaining the relative economic success of each country. The main focus of study will be on identifying and comparing the relative importance of those factors that appear to have hindered, or have promoted economic development in each of the three economies. Among the main themes to be explored are the roles of rural development and technology, peasant society and other cultural influences affecting economic growth, manufacturing industry and industrialisation, population growth, urbanisation, foreign influences, and economic systems. Analytical emphasis will be on identifying and comparing long-run determinants of each country's success (or the lack of it) in achieving economic growth and development.", "outcome": "", "area": "ECHI", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have completed ECON1101 Microeconomics 1, and ECON1102 Macroeconomics 1 or ECON1100 Economics 1 (H), or 72 units.

Through the framework of comparative politics, it will take on several major themes including democratization, identity politics, corruption, and development. In ordinary language, comparisons are often implicit, and arguments are based on weak evidence or poor logic. In this course, students will master not just facts and figures, but a sophisticated approach to analysis that can be used in the study of politics not just of countries in Asia but around the world. The twin thrusts of this course will be learning how to evaluate key concepts in political science (e.g. democracy), and learning how to draw valid causal inferences from comparative political analysis. Students will thus develop the skills to critically evaluate causal claims made in academic, policy, and journalistic writing. The course will be structured by first introducing students to key theoretical and comparative works on selected themes and then applying the approaches comparatively across and within countries in Asia. At the end of the course, students will have a  greater understanding of political events in Asia and have better understood why it matters for us to think about the region comparatively.", "outcome": "", "area": "ASIA", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed 24 units of university courses.

Although this idea is contested, the Australian government consistently identifies this arc as the region from or through which a security threat to Australia could most easily be posed. As a result, Australia is engaged in extensive efforts to support stability and security in this region, which is the site of the majority of Australia's military deployments, policing operations and development expenditure. This course critically analyses the security challenges facing this arc, and the efforts Australia is taking to secure the region. These efforts include transnational crime and counterterrorism cooperation, natural disaster response, intervention and stabilisation, criminal justice assistance, governance capacity-building and development assistance.

The Buddhist path consists in the combined practice of philosophical reasoning, ethical practice and meditation. This course will focus on philosophical reasoning. For Buddhists, enlightenment is attained by gaining insight into the nature of reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), language (philosophy of language) and our ways of living (ethics). These insights are acquired, in large part, by subjecting our beliefs to rational scrutiny. In this course, we critically examine some of the core issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics that are elaborated by Buddhist philosophers. The course proceeds by analyzing some core texts of Buddhist philosophy (in English translation) together with some secondary literature. We study Buddhist philosophy not as an item of historical and cultural interest but as an attempt to ascertain how much truth lies in this system of thought. Once we gain an understanding of the views expounded by Buddhist philosophers, we will subject their doctrines to rational scrutiny in the hope of attaining some enlightenment for ourselves.", "outcome": "Demonstrate a general knowledge of some major schools, figures and issues in the Buddhist tradition of PhilosophyExpress and expound views and pre-suppositions of Buddhist philosophers clearly and lucidly;Understand and critically evaluate theories, arguments and presuppositions of Buddhist philosophers", "area": "PHIL", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "6 units of Philosophy (PHIL) courses, or with permission of the course convenor.", "semester":[], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

In the first part, it examines the most colossal attempt at 'mind control' in human history - the attempt by the Communist Party between 1949 and 1978 to create new, revolutionary human beings by imposing centralised control of language and discourse.  What were the origins of this attempt?  How did it affect people's behaviour? How did it affect Chinese culture?  And how successful was it in changing people's ideas and values?  In the second part of the course it will explore the enormous changes that have occurred since the beginning of the Reform Era in 1978.  Why did Deng and his successors relax controls over language and discourse?  What social and economic changes have encouraged the emergence of new discourses and cultural forms?  What opportunities have been created by the explosive growth of the internet?  How does the government continue to regulate the media and manipulate public debate?  How have people sought to get around the restrictions?  What critical discourses still manage to flourish?

{ "code":"ASIA2073", "title":"Chinese Calligraphy: History and Practice", "description": " Had I been born Chinese, I would have been a calligrapher, not a painter. said Pablo Picasso. Why was calligraphy so attractive to him? Why has the art of writing lines become so appealing? Chinese calligraphy certainly is a second to none art form, and is without doubt the most important form of art in Chinese history. In daily and academic lives, Chinese words/characters are not only for embodying meaning, but also for various purposes of cultural expression, such as writing, artistic performing, religion, aesthetics and philosophy, social life and tempering personality. In fact, it is rare to find any Chinese literati without the ability to function in this art in earlier historical periods. Therefore, it can be said that Chinese culture truly is a filled culture of words.Additionally, Chinese history is closely reflected in the long development of Chinese characters, which has evolved into different styles. It creates a set of delicate and profound Chinese aesthetic theory, which echoes Chinese art theory and philosophy, such as the vacuity vs. substance (or the empty/illusionary vs. the real/full/solid/the substance), and loose vs. density, or the dialectical relationship betweenblackness vs. whiteness (or the black line vs. the white space). Chinese calligraphy can also be said to be a unique abstract art through linear expression. In Taiwan, Mainland China, Korea and Japan, postgraduate degrees in calligraphy are offered in Chinese or art departments. Learning and knowing Chinese calligraphy as such is necessary for all Chinese studies, especially those wanting an advanced understanding about Chinese history and culture.This course provides students with a general, yet profound, introduction to Chinese calligraphy. Through practice and knowledge acquirement, such as holding a brush, writing and knowing the knowledge of the four treasures, students can experience this ancient Chinese art and cultivate an interest for Chinese culture. As simplified Chinese has gradually become a dominant trend nowadays, traditional Chinese nevertheless is still a genuine access point to Chinese culture and Sinology in terms of its history, aesthetics and philosophy and literati circles. Simplified vs. traditional characters also reflects in different Chinese societies, namely Mainland China and Taiwan. Students will learn how to write and appreciate this art of lines, accompanied by the knowledge of its history and theory.", "outcome": "", "area": "ASIA", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed at least 24 units of university courses.", "semester":[], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

Even after the collapse of the major historic imperial powers during the second half of the twentieth century, the legacies of those empires continue to shape contemporary life. And historians and political analysts still talk in terms of - and seek to redefine - imperialism in reference to present polities.  China is central to such discourses on imperial power: it offers a particularly rich body of historical evidence for the practice of empire. This introductory course will therefore assess that evidence and survey the great drama of Chinese attempts to bring under single control and preserve the unity of its vast territories, so varied ethnically, culturally, and geographically. It will take in the full sweep of China's imperial past: it will start in the third century BC, when the foundations of the imperial system were consolidated; it will reach into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when encounters with Western powers forced a radical reappraisal of the Chinese imperial system. Dividing this broad chronological scope into three periods - early China, medieval China, and late imperial China - it will offer a sense of larger changes and continuities over time. Within each period, it will bring into sharp focus the social, cultural, and political arenas in which Chinese empire was developed and maintained.", "outcome": "", "area": "ASIA", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed at least 24 units of university courses.

In asking this question Contemporary Social Theory puts forward a case for the practical value of theory.

Most importantly, then, the course aims to develop skills and give you confidence in your capacity to think, so that you can engage with issues and empirical problems in an original way. While Contemporary Social Theory covers some of the important thinkers of the post- war period, its aim is not to provide a comprehensive survey of the vast array of social theorists that you might find in a text on social or sociological theory. The idea is to expose you to some of the key problems that have animated sociology and cognate disciplines in recent years, with the hope that you might have a window into these and similar theoretical and practical problems. On the way through the course, we will pay attention to the question of what it means for thinking to be 'contemporary'.

Development of these skills marks the difference between secondary education with an emphasis on information-based learning and tertiary with its focus on critical analysis.  Critical thinking is at the core of most intellectual activity that involves students in learning to recognise or develop an argument, use evidence in support of that argument, draw reasoned conclusions, and use information to solve problems. Examples of thinking skills are interpreting, analysing, evaluating, explaining, sequencing, reasoning, comparing, questioning, inferring,hypothesising, appraising, testing and generalising. Creative thinking involves students in learning to generate and apply new ideas in specific contexts, seeing existing situations in a new way, identifying alternative explanations, and seeing or making new links that generate a positive outcome. This includes combining parts to form something original, sifting and refining ideas to discover possibilities, constructing theories and objects, and acting on intuition.

These differences can be profound and systematic. Today's transnational flows of people, ideas, languages, and practices mean that we encounter these differences in contexts ranging from home, school, hospital, workplaces, to international business, tourism, diplomacy and humanitarian work. This drives the need to understand both 'cross-cultural communication' (communication across different groups and societies) and 'intercultural communication' (communication within groups and societies).  How people choose to interact with others stems from the languages they speak, and also from their histories, the values of the groups they identify with, their relations with their interactants, the goals of the interaction, the setting in which it takes place and the medium (digital, face-to-face, written).  We explore these from a linguistic perspective, critically examining the empirical basis for claims made about communication in a range of societies including, for example, Australia, the US, Indigenous Australia, China, France, Germany, Japan, Israel, Korea, and Hispanic speech communities.

{ "code":"BIAN2120", "title":"Culture, Biology and Population Dynamics", "description": "The potential of human populations to grow, stabilise or decline is realised through events which are often strongly marked culturally and always crucial for individuals: birth, migration and death. The prospects and hazards of survival, mobility, marriage and raising a family vary greatly between populations, and are often related to sociocultural factors including religion, education, gender roles, valuation of children, political organisation and economy. Yet if sociocultural factors are to influence the dynamics of fertility and mortality, they must do so through their effects on those very biological events, giving birth and dying. This course explores in an anthropological context the complex interplay between culture and biology in producing population dynamics of different kinds, as well as the implications of those population dynamics for the societies in question. Course topics include: population size and structure in the past and present; the biology of natural fertility; social factors controlling fertility; mortality and the impact of varying life expectancies; population pressure on resources and consequences for migration; marital mobility, marriage practices, kinship systems and sex ratios; the demography of small-scale societies; health, nutrition and the demographic effect of epidemics; demographic implications of warfare; change, development and demographic transitions. Quantitative demographic techniques are introduced but not pursued in depth. Examples are drawn from around the world, including the Australasian region. The course is designed on the premise that what is distinctive about the anthropological (in the broad sense) approach to population is its concern with the processes that lie behind population numbers more than the numbers themselves, and its comparative perspective across cultures and from the distant past to the present.", "outcome": "Master the essentials of the factual groundwork and demonstrate awareness of key facts and the contributions of pivotal authors in the literature which examines human population dynamics cross-culturally and (in the broad sense) anthropologicallyDemonstrate a secure grasp of fundamental concepts in anthropological demography and demographic anthropologyMaster basic demographic methods and measures sufficiently to be able to calculate simpler measures and draw correct inferences from quantitative results on fertility, mortality, migration and other demographic topics (but note that more advanced technical demography is covered in other courses)Use a selective case study approach to explain a topic or argument in the field orally to your peers, in a clear, concise, analytical and evidence-based manner, couched so as to elicit discussion; and respond thoughtfully to the substance of peersÃ¢ similar contributionsDraw together material from a range of scholarly sources relevant to a topic or proposition in the field, to form a unified text which sets out your own independent, where appropriate critical, assessment of that material, balancing general argument and supporting evidence", "area": "BIAN", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "12 units of 1000-level ANTH, ARCH, BIOL or SOCY courses.

{ "code":"ENVS3014", "title":"Ecological Assessment and Management", "description": "Effective management and conservation of ecosystems requires an ability to quantify what is there and how it is changing; as well as an understanding of the options to manage these ecosystems for sustainability. This course investigates the use of broadly applicable ecological principles and methods to restore or sustainably manage woodland and forest ecosystems. We begin with how desirable objectives for sustainable ecosystem management can be defined, particularly focusing on criteria and indicators, the adaptive management cycle and a precautionary approach. A range of examples including traditional silvicultural and other systems is used to explore how plant community structures and dynamics can be manipulated to achieve management objectives. The course uses a hands-on approach to develop skills in the quantitative assessment, measurement and modelling techniques that are fundamental to assessing the state of an ecosystem. Field exercises are designed to provide experience in assessing whether applied management approaches are leading to the desired changes in system structure and dynamics. The field and applied focus of the course provides experience with the basic quantitative skills that are sought by employers of natural resource management and ecology graduates in areas ranging from hands-on management to policy. Students apply their learning to a management planning task within the major assignment, and deliver the results of their work in a conference-style setting at the end of the semester. Smaller quizzes and reports throughout the course help develop skills to assess and interpret forest and woodland structures and conditions, and to develop solutions for multiple management objectives. Students may expect to interact with researchers and other professionals from the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Forests NSW, Greening Australia, and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Honours Pathway OptionSubject to the approval of the course convener students taking this option must demonstrate greater depth in the philosophy and use of modelling for environmental/forest management.

We consider how organisms interact with their physical environment and with each other to shape their individual attributes, patterns of population dynamics, distribution, diversity and abundance; and across scales of time and space, the patterns and processes of community assembly and ecosystem function. Why are some organisms found here, and not there? Why do plants and animals look and work like they do? What makes their populations large or small, or change in size? Why do some organisms co-exist together, and others not? Why is there so much diversity? In understanding these questions, we gain critical insight into how populations and communities have evolved, how energy and biomass flow through ecosystems, and how populations and communities respond to changes in their environment. These changes may result from natural disturbances such as changes in climate, through altered disease prevalence or competition, or from human modification of habitat, perhaps through overharvesting or species removal. The aim of this course is to provide a foundation in ecological thinking, in relevant field methods and in the application of ecology for understanding and conserving natural ecosystems. The course will consider the major biological kingdoms, and will address key themes, including the study of organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems, placing them in context across physical scales from the individual to the Earth system, across processes from the flow of mass and energy to biotic interactions such as competition, and across modes of study from theory to practice.", "outcome": "Examine and summarise central ideas underpinning the ecology of individuals, populations, communities & ecosystems;Integrate ecological understanding of processes operating across multiple scales of space and time;Use observation, experimentation and modelling to generate and test ecological hypotheses;Critically evaluate scientific evidence to understand ecological patterns and processes;Conduct basic ecological research and communicate the findings;Work as a research team and provide effective peer support and feedback.", "area": "BIOL", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have successfully completed BIOL1003.

As the reach and impact of conventional and traditional media declines due to digital disruption, new media is rapidly evolving. In the academic space, reaching key audiences means engaging with them in the many places that they now get their news, views and analysis. ANU is a pioneer and leader in online academic blogs - which have become a key platform to achieve this.In this internship-based practicum course, students will learn to be Editors on these online platforms. This highly practical course will teach students how to edit other people's work, the business challenges of running an online platform, how to design and implement social media and audience engagement strategies, and how to measure impact and reach. It will also equip students with skills to create a range of media for use on these platforms, including audio podcasts.The course will be based around a series of workshops, combined with each student undertaking a placement at one of The Australian National University's leading blog sites.

Our lectures are organised into four modules: trade-offs between costs and benefits for survival and reproduction, the principles of animal communication, the evolution of cooperation, and the biology of sex. We consider such questions as: How do individuals balance the need to get food yet avoid predators? How are communication signals designed and what do they mean? What stops animals lying? Why is cooperation potentially beneficial yet its evolution is difficult to understand? When is it advantageous to produce sons versus daughters? Why are individuals choosy when selecting a mate? Why do males care for young in some species but not others?

The traditional definition of security premised on military defence of a territory puts human security and social factors at the periphery. Advocates for a human security approach argue that to insist on a narrower state-centric security paradigm at the expense of human security would leave the concept of security bereft of any practical meaning in many real-world circumstances. What is human security, and what kinds of security issues, problems or conflicts can it be applied to? How do human security perspectives generate different approaches and policies to traditional security thinking? In what ways does a human security approach provide innovative perspectives to address sources of insecurity more holistically? This course will critically examine the human security concept and a range of key human security issues in the Asian region, including intra-state and ethnic conflict, post-conflict peace building, displaced persons and refugees, landmines and small arms, the protection of children in conflict, and poverty and human development.The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity.

{ "code":"ANTH3017", "title":"Indigenous Worlds: Challenges of Emergence, Recognition, and Change", "description": "Over the last forty years, a global discourse of indigeneity and indigenous peoples has emerged, originating and diffusing in the 1980s and onwards from particular nation-states. This internationalist concept of indigeneity had been centered in the United Nations, and enshrined in documents of other multilateral organisations (the World Bank, International Labor Organisation). Peoples now often regarded as `indigenous' have long existed - but this category is relatively recent, as are many developments associated with it.Like other such global discourses (e.g. `nationalism'), how indigeneity is understood varies across particular contexts. Its global dissemination makes such variability inevitable, and the question of how it intersects with particular socio-economic-political conjunctures, essential. Generally speaking, indigenous-settler dynamics (such as are found in Australia, North America, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America) have been, in some respects, most receptive of the collective, internationally-authored, `indigenous' socio-political identity. For example, Australia as a state accepts the notion that it is home to `indigenous' people. The recent concept of indigeneity has been seen as more ambiguous, unsettling, or downright threatening, hence less acceptable, in many Asian, East and South Asian, as well as African countries. This course will examine the intersections of international concept and national circumstances, both conceptually and by case studies.This course will look at questions of the emergence of an internationalist global category from two principal directions underpinned by readings from anthropological theorists on: the reification of cultural constructs, capitalist constructions of meaning, and the exercise of powers of recognition and legitimation, the changing role of nation-states globally (Bourdieu, Foucault, Wolf); and more political-economically situated ideas concerning the current global conjuncture, how and why this particular kind of internationalist category has emerged and its intersection with what Kalb (2009) calls `critical junctions that link global process via particular national arenas and local histories, often hidden, to emergent and situated events and narratives¦'Students will work through a number of case studies of indigenous peoples and settings; and discuss what has happened in various cases, the extent to which the category `indigenous' has been mobilized concerning and by particular groups, and consider what the future of this category of `indigeneity' may be.", "outcome": "Discuss the history of events and factors in the emergence of examples of international and national indigenous movements and activisms.Understand the relation of this emergence to theory and practice both in development and anthropology.Draw upon major theoretical debates in anthropology in terms of which this emergence has been understood, and to interpret and evaluate these theoretical approaches.

As the nation with the fourth-largest population in the world, and as the third-largest democracy, Indonesia rightly aspires to expand its influence and have a greater say in international affairs. But both its foreign policy and its regional and international security policy have often been criticised as insufficient to achieve this goal. What, then, have been the hurdles to Indonesia's development into a key diplomatic and security actor? What have successive Indonesian presidents done to overcome these obstacles and increase Indonesia's international weight? How do Indonesia's neighbors, including Australia, view Indonesia's foreign and security potential, and its limitations? What is the most likely trajectory of Indonesia's foreign and security role in the decades ahead?In this course, we will investigate the questions outlined above, and evaluate Indonesia's status in the web of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific region. In doing so, we will also reflect on key theoretical and conceptual questions in regards to the sources of a country's diplomatic and strategic power.

This course will cover the main topics in these fields including personnel selection, performance management, training and development, motivation, teams, leadership, and organisational culture and change. A distinctive aspect of the course is a focus on the social psychology of organisations and as a result the role of group psychology and processes in organisational functioning. There is a recognition that Industrial and Organisational psychology are concerned with the impact of organizational strategy and culture, structures, and processes on the individual (and vice versa) and not the individual in isolation (e.g., individual counseling in a work context). In lectures students can expect to gain an overview of key topics in Industrial and Organisational Psychology and in the laboratory program more practical know-how about how to effectively work with others in a team environment (team work, leadership dynamics, giving and receiving feedback). Many aspects of the laboratory program will mirror management-type training with group exercises followed by discussion and exploration of team dynamics.

Yet the Cold War never really ended in the Asia-Pacific. Its legacy is still very much apparent in the form of the America-led bilateral network of security alliances and with the persistence of dangerous flashpoints on the Korean Peninsula and across the Taiwan Strait. Longstanding historical tensions persist between Japan and Korea, China and Japan and India and Pakistan, to name just a few. In the interim, new powers such as China and India have risen at impressive rates, spending some of their newfound wealth on increasingly sophisticated weaponry. All of this, in turn, has created new interstate security dilemmas in the Asia-Pacific region and has generated speculation that a new 'arms race' is emerging as more established players respond in kind to these acquisitions.

In particular, we will investigate how the locally embodied cultural practices meshed with the fast changing socioeconomic and cultural circumstances in Korea as well as the unprecedented pace of globalization in order to understand Korea within the broader regional and global context.The course places special focus on the films of five prominent South Korean directors. Each director is known for his or her unique style and mode of representation of a particular theme.

In a world where multilingualism and variation in language is the norm and monolingualism the exception, migration and technological advances have generated new challenges for language policy makers, causing new issues of language choice to emerge.The core issues to be addressed in this course are: How and why national and official languages are chosen and what this means politically in a society; How language education policy can affect members of a society; How the spread of English as a world language has affected the linguistic ecology of societies around the globe, and how its spread is related to the proliferation of World Englishes; How societies treat indigenous languages; How minority language rights pose challenges for policy makers at the national and supranational level.

The emphasis in this course is on thinking like an economist to understand legal issues from an economic perspective, with a focus on a clear understanding of the logic and underlying economic intuition rather than just the results.Law and Economics is designed for both economics and law students. For economics students, it is an interesting application of the economic way of thinking to real world problems and policy issues. Examining actual legal cases gives students experience in relating abstract economic models to practical problems and demonstrates their direct relevance.Although economics can help explain law, the influence of the law on the economy is far more important. Legal and political foundations underlie economic performance. The law is an important social institution and incentive structure that provides a foundation for the economic order and plays a central role in determining social outcomes, yet economists often take it for granted.Understanding law helps us better understand the workings of the economic system. Economic analysis rests on a bedrock of legal relations that law and economics explicitly analyses. Free markets do not exist within a vacuum, but need a legal framework that protects property, enforces contracts and allows free exchange to flourish. Law provides the framework in which firms and individuals decide on their actions in the economic sphere. For law students, Judge Richard Posner (one of the founders of law and economics) explains the benefits of law and economics well: The law is divided into numerous fields, each of which has a complex structure of rules. The fields are traditionally studied in isolation from one another, and within each field the rules tend also to be studied as a separate, often self-enclosed bodies of thought. Yet it turns out that a relative handful of economic doctrines - such as decision under uncertainty, transactions costs, cost benefit analysis, risk aversion, and positive and negative externalities - can, by repeated application across fields of law and legal rules, describe a great deal of the legal system and enable the student to develop a more coherent sense of the system - to grasp the relation of its parts and understand its essential unity.The 'economic approach' to law provides a unified vision of the law, tying together diverse areas of law into a common theoretical structure. The logic of the problems the law exists to solve is the same across all the standard fields, making it possible to understand a wide variety of legal issues in terms of one central set of interrelated concepts. Understanding the economics of property helps you understand torts and contracts, rather than treating them as isolated fields.The important interdependencies between law and economics mean understanding law improves economic analysis and economic analysis is a useful tool for understanding law and for devising laws that improve society and economic performance.TextbookA.

The course uses three main approaches: interrogating myths and legends in the light of historical evidence; biographical vignettes of men and women, from a range of class and ethnic backgrounds, whose stories tell us about various periods and episodes extending from the earliest cultural encounters between British settlers and Indigenous people to recent history; and the analytical frame of gender - so that we can see how changing ideas of femininity and masculinity have shaped Australians' lives.Using these three approaches, the course surveys the making and meaning of Australian history over more than two centuries.", "outcome": "", "area": "HIST", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have completed 12 units of 1000 level History (HIST) courses.You are not able to enrol in this course if you have previously completed HIST6244.", "semester":[2], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

A command of Literary Chinese is therefore indispensable for the study of any aspect of Chinese literature, thought, history, politics, or society before the twentieth century.The idioms, syntax, style, and allusions of Literary Chinese continue to pervade the modern language. Its enduring influence results from the fact that the great legacies of Chinese culture, right down to the present day, have been largely preserved in this medium. Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. It has also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.This course focuses on the analysis and translation of a selection of texts for beginners from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods.

All financial institutions, including consumer banks and corporate finance services, practice some form of marketing. Some firms market themselves better than others, as evidenced in the competitive value of their brands.This course will demonstrate to students the benefits of using an analytical approach to marketing in the financial services industry, and will show students how to undertake that analysis. An analytical approach helps firms to (1) identify marketing options, (2) calibrate the opportunity costs associated with each option, and (3) choose the best option to achieve the firm's business goals.This course operationalizes several marketing concepts such as segmentation, targeting, and positioning. By the end of this course, students will know how to segment customers, what kind of data are required to do so, what are the different ways to segment, which customers to target, how to determine the best positioning of your brand in customers' minds, how to develop new products/services that add value to consumers and firms, how to price financial products, how to efficiently manage multiple brands across multiple segments in order to meet corporate bottom-line goals, how to develop a brand, how to migrate a brand when brands are acquired or merged, and how to co-brand financial services.The pedagogic philosophy in this course is that of learning by doing. Therefore, students will go beyond learning conceptual marketing material to learning how to do marketing, using real and simulated data from the financial services industry.", "outcome": "outline how to identify which customers to target; and,outline how to efficiently manage multiple product or brand portfolios across multiple customer segments, and how to develop an effective marketing strategy in modern financial service organisations.", "area": "MKTG", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have completed a STAT course", "semester":[2], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water loom large in the popular imaginary. However, resource conflicts in the global South are predominantly fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state. Indeed, according to the United Nations, at least 40 percent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. It is these sorts of conflicts that are the focus of this course.A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather than contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood that a country will experience internal armed conflict. How and why is this the case? What about the role of resource scarcity as driver of violent conflict in developing-country contexts? What sort of policy responses and interventions are available? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What is the role of political and economic contestation in these struggles over land and natural resources?The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. A political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of how land and different types of resource complexes - including mining, oil and gas, forestry, and oil palm - can be implicated in violent conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors - especially the state, communities and corporations - and to questions of scale, power and identity.The course will have a very strong research-led approach to teaching and learning.

In the Australasian region there is a rich body of evidence for past environmental change that is only beginning to be explored. In this course we introduce the participants to the exciting potential of reconstructing past environments and how this might inform future challenges.Existing lines of evidence for past environmental change in Australia come from a range of palaeoecological and archaeological sources and point to significant changes in climate, biodiversity, vegetation cover and fire frequency since the arrival of people sometime between 50,000 - 40,000 years ago. The degree to which humans overrode otherwise natural processes of environmental change and the extent of this modification however, is a global issue. Through this course students will gain the temporal perspective necessary for understanding many contemporary environmental issues such as climate change, biological responses to environmental change and land degradation. Students will be introduced to the methods and techniques used to reconstruct past environments primarily through the field collection and laboratory analysis of a range of palaeoenvironmental indicators such as lake sediment, pollen, charcoal, seeds, biogenic silica and stable isotopes.  Common statistical and computing approaches for the acquisition, interpretation and modelling of proxy environmental data are also explored.

The first half of the course concerns general issues in assessing the impact of policy interventions and serves as a philosophical critique of the contemporary 'evidence-based policy' movement: What are the arguments for/against alternative measures of policy success or social wellbeing? What is the relevant notion of causation when it comes to attributing outcomes to particular policies, and what counts as good evidence of causal influence? How should risky policies be compared, especially where the risks and benefits of the various policies are distributed 'unevenly' across the population? The second half of the course considers more specific constraints/aims of policy, often with reference to particular policy areas. Topics will vary but may include: ¢ In what contexts, if any, is government paternalism appropriate?¢ What is the significance of personal responsibility in the distribution of shared resources?¢ Is there a right to privacy?¢ What are our rights to freedom of expression?¢ How should we respond to minority under-representation in public institutions?¢ Is there a collective right to deny citizenship to others, i.e., to control immigration?¢ Is statistical discrimination (e.g. racial profiling) ever justified?¢ How can/should citizens and their representatives access scientific knowledge pertinent to policy?", "outcome": "Understand and articulate key philosophical issues pertaining to the design and evaluation of public policyEngage with and critically evaluate (in essay form) philosophical arguments concerning moral/political philosophy and philosophy of science that are pertinent to policy-makingEngage in well-reasoned, justified and articulate discussion and debate.", "area": "PHIL", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "", "semester":[1], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

Does China's rapidly growing economy  endow it with a potent economic instrument of power? Is the soft power of the West declining amid global financial crisis and domestic political turmoil? Who is winning the contest of great powers in the 21st century? This course focuses on puzzles like these, examining how power is accumulated and wielded in international relations, and the conditions under which its use can be successful. States are the primary focus of the course, and five primary modes of power will be studied: military power, economic power, institutional power, soft power and hegemonic power. The objective of this course is to provide the student with a broad and deep understanding of how power can be conceptualised, measured, and deployed in international relations, and the conditions for its successful use. The course considers a wide range of contemporary issues and case studies relating to the use of power, including: Military power and the winning of wars Hegemonic power and leadership of the international system Technology-based instruments of power, such as drones, cyber and financial sanctions.

Besides accreditation, the work experience has the following two purposes: to expose the student to the workplace and workplace issues (such as human and industrial relations, job organisation, maintenance, safety and environmental issues). to provide direct insight into professional engineering practice.It is the student's responsibility to obtain the employment. The School of Engineering provides several resources to help students find work experience, including an annual seminar held in second semester, an ENGN 3100 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document and a list of past employers (updated at the end of each semester).As a general rule, the ideal would be 12 weeks (420 hours) in an engineering environment where the student is working with or supervised by engineers. Also acceptable is 8 weeks in an engineering environment and remaining 4 weeks in any sort of employment. A variation of this scheme that may be acceptable in a handful of special cases is 4 weeks in any sort of employment, 4 weeks in employment in a technical industry of some kind and 4 weeks of work with engineers in an engineering environment. All work experience claimed must have been completed since the commencement of the degree.Students are required to submit a 10-15 page report upon completion of their work experience.

But how did having a woman in charge influence this evolving artform? The Queen staged her authority in elaborate rituals, called herself a 'prince', and declined to marry.

Comedies often resolve these crises through marriage but are likewise populated by articulate female characters and driven by gender disguise.

At issue is the quality of one's beliefs, desires and choices about how to act, particularly in the face of uncertainty, and in concert with others.Part I is a critical examination of the standard theory of individual rationality - expected utility theory - that unites and explicates the aforementioned key mental attitudes. This theory stems from the classic work of philosophers/social scientists such as Ramsey, de Finetti and Savage. Contemporary challenges to the standard theory come from diverse directions, with some arguing that the theory is too little constrained and even vacuous, others arguing that it is too rigid, either in its prescriptions for representing and handling uncertainty or else by virtue of being in conflict with some prominent ethical accounts of right action, and yet others arguing that it gives outright bad advice in various special cases. The course considers these challenges to the standard theory and the responses/developments they have inspired.Part II turns to rationality in a social context. The initial focus is the theory of games, applicable to cases where what an individual should do depends on what others do, and vice versa. Standard solution concepts for games are introduced, and the collective-action problems that may arise, including possibilities for their resolution, are considered, with an eye to the ethical significance of these scenarios. Finally, the course turns to group choice proper, where individuals effectively join forces and act as a single entity. Here the starting point for investigation is Arrow's theorem regarding the (im)possibility of an adequate group aggregation of individual attitudes; this invites examination of Arrow's assumptions, and raises further questions regarding interpersonal comparability and the plausibility of Utilitarianism and other aggregative solutions.", "outcome": "Understand and articulate key philosophical issues pertaining to rational choice and inference, both for individuals and groupsEngage with and critically evaluate (in essay form) formal and discursive material relevant to individual, game and social choice theoryEngage in well-reasoned, justified and articulate discussion and debate.", "area": "PHIL", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "6 units of Philosophy (PHIL) courses, or with permission of the course convenor.", "semester":[], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

Two areas of contemporary culture will be of particular interest to this unit:(1) issues surrounding advertising, corporate power and globalisation, and(2) debates about the representation of gender and sexuality in the media and popular culture.In the first half of the course, students will learn to use semiotics, a method that is widely used by cultural and feminist critics to study how meanings are produced in images and texts. Coupling semiotics with theories of identity, subjectivity, ideology and discourse students will analyse power relationships in popular culture. Students will also become familiar with debates relating to production and consumption. Upon completing the course requirements, students will have experience in applying core methods and theories analytically, and will be able to demonstrate critical reflection on key concepts shared by cultural and gender studies.", "outcome": "understand the central model for this course: the 'circuit of culture';master a variety of tools for cultural studies and be able to use them in a concrete study of cultural practices, commodities, images, and social media campaigns in contemporary culture;become familiar with developments and current debates within the field of cultural studies in a digital era, particularly issues surrounding; advertising, identity and gender;improve skills in independent research and in written and oral communication.", "area": "GEND", "level": "1000", "prereq_text": "", "semester":[2], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

In the middle of the 20th century, in the aftermath of the Second World War, policy-makers became aware that the terms of peace could have a powerful impact on the likelihood of return to conflict. Significant progress has been made in developing peace-making processes that undercut the original causes of conflict and which thus diminish the possibility that conflict will recur. Architectures of international cooperation and inter-dependence also work to diminish the possibility of war. The historical memory of conflict, however, has proven to be a serious and intractable obstacle to international harmony. The historical bitterness that afflicts Japan's relations with Korea and China is greater now than at any time since the Second World War. Ancient antagonisms pit Cambodia against its two neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam. The memory of the massacre of communists in Indonesia 50 years ago looms as an issue in contemporary Indonesian politics. Meanwhile, formal and informal reconciliation process in various countries of the region (including Korea, Cambodia and East Timor) have shed light on possible paths to preventing the legacies of bitter histories from causing ongoing conflict.This course will critically analyse the processes used in dealing with the past, as well as the prospects and challenges for cooperation and reconciliation.

To operate effectively in such an environment, today's science communicators must be able to tell the difference between good research and bad, even if that research falls beyond their personal scientific skillset and experience.  They must possess the skills and knowledge to critique the evidence at the base of science-related issues affecting society today. In parallel, they need to understand, and be able to apply, science communication research to their own communication practice.This course emphasizes the analysis, critique and communication of science and scientific evidence in the context of identifying, understanding and critiquing examples of social influence and change.The course focuses on cases of critical societal challenges that have significant science bases such as¢ Climate change¢ Alternative energy¢ Public health (e.g., vitamin supplements, vaccination, homeopathic remedies)¢ Natural disaster mitigation and survival (e.g., bushfires, tsunamis)¢ Health and safety legislation (e.g., illicit drugs, road safety, GM foods)¢ The role of scientific research in society (e.g., curiosity driven versus applied)To be able to successfully appraise the relative merits of evidence, both for scientific and science communication research, students in this course will be exposed to the philosophy and reasoning behind common quantitative and qualitative methods and methodological argument.Scientific research, analysis and communication will be considered from the multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives of formal researchers, politicians, the media, and society at large.", "outcome": "", "area": "SCOM", "level": "1000", "prereq_text": "", "semester":[2], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

Is it possible to speak about real or true risks in science? How do the concepts of risk and ethics relate?In recent years, issues such as global warming, environmental degradation and gene technologies have highlighted a critical need for society to question the risks and ethics of science and the way related matters are presented within societies. In this course, the practice and application of science is analysed from risk-communication and ethical perspectives. Consideration is given to how the history of scientific research might inform contemporary debates about risk. The concept of ethical research is analysed and challenged and the communication of risk and uncertainty among Western and non-Western publics is examined in detail. This course focuses on the creation of clearer and more effective ways to communicate more controversial, risky, and potential unethical scientific matters to larger audiences.

This means observing how social factors like sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, health and socioeconomic status mediate the treatment people receive from institutions and organisations and operate to shape their everyday experiences.We will contemplate how exposure to culture socialises individuals into adopting particular values, sentiments and belief systems, perceptions and understandings of the social world that inform the way people behave in various contexts. This focus invites us to think about the diverse forms of power that operate in society, in terms of who has privileged access to 'the truth' and to constructing and disseminating this knowledge, and who is marginalised or excluded from the process, and what factors account for this asymmetry. Overall, the course will provide a greater understanding of:1. what sociology is (and does) and what makes it unique when compared to other disciplines like anthropology and psychology;2. what types of questions sociologists ask, what research approaches they adopt and what kinds of social behaviour, events and problems they analyse;3. how sociological knowledge impacts on society.", "outcome": "", "area": "SOCY", "level": "1000", "prereq_text": "", "semester":[1], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

Early understandings of animals focused on their sustenance and symbolic value, and structuralist perspectives placed animals centrally in marrige and other systems of great importance to human social lives. More recent approaches have retained the notion that animals are important because they offer insight into human conceptualisations of and actions in the world.

To achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and to align social, economic and environmental objectives will require a fundamental change in production, consumption and infrastructure delivery. We explore how a better understanding of institutions and governance can inform well-designed policies that facilitate sustainable consumption and production.In this course we explore the complex interrelationships between social, economic and political processes and the environment. We consider economic processes (consumption and production), social processes (in which economic processes are embedded) and decision-making processes and institutional arrangements including issues of participation and the potential for adaptive responses to environmental change. We review society-nature interactions in history, look at the role of population, demography and consumption in environmental change and touch upon urbanization and new middle class consumers.The course takes a social-ecological perspective on environmental change and analyses the role of important social subsystems - the economy, the legal system, the political system and science - for steering society nature interactions.We are interested to explore how the social relationship with nature is shaped, maintained and can be transformed. This allows us to investigate how the agency of social actors is constrained and enabled by natural and social conditions that we can address in both material and symbolic terms to inform policies and business practices that may contribute to sustainable development.In particular, the course will address such questions as: what is the capacity of modern society to manage natural resources sustainably and to reduce emissions?

Why is this? There is a growing understanding in society of the importance of respect and protection of animals as an indicator of the ethical maturity of a society.  The way in which society exploits animals for our entertainment, pleasure and consumption therefore raises profound moral, ethical and legal issues. Accordingly, ethical animal welfare, the protection of animals for their own sake as sentient beings with a capacity for suffering, is no doubt one of the basic values of modern western states. This interaction between human activities and animal interests is a serious area of academic inquiry giving rise to significant legal regulatory and socio-ethical issues.Adopting an inter-disciplinary approach, this new elective course will consider animals within established categories of law such as property, (for example, s.2 of the Australian Consumer Law and s 4 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) defines goods to include animals), but will also examine the legal status and regulation of the treatment of within broader social, philosophical and legal contexts. This includes an economic and scientific context, an environmental context, and an ethical-political context. Students will therefore be challenged in their traditional understanding of animals as they are conceptualised in law (including underlying philosophical assumptions) and to critically evaluate the way the legal system influences the interests of animals within society.In this way, an examination of animals through prevailing and traditional legal doctrines is critiqued and evaluated through the insights of other academic disciplines such as philosophy, economics and science. This approach will provide students with an opportunity for critical reflection on the legal and ethical interaction between humans and animals as manifested in the law.", "outcome": "", "area": "LAWS", "level": "4000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must be studying a program which includes the Bachelor of laws or Juris Doctor and completed or be completing five LAWS 1000 or 6100 level courses or JD(O) and have completed LAWS8712 Australian Public Law and International Law B.", "semester":[], "pre_req_cnf":[]}

We will examine concepts, and look at examples of practices and processes in a number of significant domains, in order to comprehend states, in their variety, in a distinctively anthropological manner. Most of our central readings are by anthropologists, and involve the relating to each other of concepts and ethnography. Central topics through which we will look at this conjunction will include everyday practices; culture and state ritual; law and regulation; personhood and agency; hidden and overt mechanisms of power; and persistent structures and emergent forms. Along the way we look at examples of some of the rubrics currently most often applied to states: the `stable' state; the `would-be' state (`Islamic state'?), the `failed' state. Ethnographically, we will especially (but not exclusively) focus on what are considered developing states, by which is meant here: those which offer fewer entitlements and have penetrated less completely into the daily lives of their citizens, than is customary in the state systems of better-off countries.

Much of what we know of the deeper past comes from natural archives of changing cultural landscapes and environment. In Australia and the Asia-Pacific region there is a rich body of evidence for past changes in culture, climate, landscape and biodiversity that is only just beginning to be explored. The evidence for critical transitions that have occurred in nature and society will be discussed and students will see first-hand examples of how environmental change has influenced past and present societies and cultures.

Personal data are a means of knowledge and power and they are put to many different ends, from governing large populations to individual constructions of identity.This course considers some of the key historical events, organisational aspirations and cultural factors responsible for the development of surveillance societies. Students will learn about the political, social, legal and ethical dimensions and implications of mass surveillance, specifically by drawing on some of the major theories in surveillance studies. We explore the interests and values underpinning the expansion of surveillance, the types of regulatory frameworks governing surveillance and the complex forms of social relations mediating surveillance processes. We will focus on various research examples to develop our knowledge and understanding of the social drivers and impacts of surveillance.The four main questions informing our coverage are:1.

Increased awareness of the significant environmental degradation, decline of natural systems and resources along with community, national and global social inequalities has placed a focus on sustainable business practices. For many it would seem that marketing has been perceived as part of the problem rather than the solution to issues such as pollution, over consumption, the depletion of natural resource, unhealthy lifestyles, and human rights abuses. However markets provide a coordinating mechanism through which change takes place. Importantly marketing systems provide the crucial link between market participants including individuals, households, managers and firms. This course evaluates the role of marketing and marketers by examining how firms create value, reduce risk and build sustainable thinking and processes into their marketing activities and strategies as they respond to opportunities and threats that arise from both social, economic and environmental change, and changing consumers attitudes and behaviour.

The course consists of three parts: firstly a strong focus on learning one of the varieties well (the choice may vary from year to year, but will normally be Tok Pisin, the variety with the most speakers) so that by the end of the semester students will have acquired a good level of proficiency in communication, written and other usages of the language; secondly, an understanding of the similarities and differences of the sound systems, vocabularies and grammars of each of the languages; thirdly, an exploration of the emergence and status of Pidgins in Melanesia, the ways in which they are embedded and deployed in contemporary Pacific societies, and their instrumental value in understanding the culture of these societies.

'Televisual' invites you to explore the significance of 'narrative television' and its impact on how stories are produced and received today. We will do so through closely reading a selection of case studies, moving from the 1950s' 'I Love Lucy' through to 'The Simpsons', 'Twin Peaks' and to a contemporary film that is arguably inspired by contemporary televisual media (Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood'). In doing so, we will engage with some of the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries' most important theorists of television narrative (including Raymond Williams and Marshall McLuhan). Beginning with television's first emergence in the 1950s, we will consider the various ways in which television has been produced, transmitted and received. Our investigation will move from television's reliance on studio recording to thinking about the importance of live and cable broadcasting and, more recently, the role of digital devices that can stream or download content. We will ask questions about what makes televisual storytelling distinct and whether or not television has influenced the development of other forms (including novels and films).

If your project spans multiple disciplines, or is genuinely 'out of the box', you'll know you're in the right course. Then you'll work on the 'Planning' stage with a mentoring panel of at least three researchers from across campus, who together will provide skills across the breadth of your project, and whose aim will be for you to succeed. Once you have worked out what you need to start making the project come to life, then it will be time for 'Doing' - fully occupying your mind and hands in ways that will turn your ideas into real things. Again you'll be fully supported by your mentors, including new ones if you find yourself needing different skills or advice.The three components of the course'The Pitch', 'Planning' and 'Doing'will take different amounts of time for different students, depending on individual creativity and interests, and are quite likely to be iterative, as each stage of thinking and learning encourages you to refine the design stages.

It combines a narrative historical perspective on European colonial history while exploring different theoretical approaches to understanding empires, what they are and how they function. These approaches will include perspectives from political sociology (such as SN Eisenstadt's The Political Systems of Empires), international relations (Michael Doyle and more recent Network centric IR approaches), and classical and current theories of economic imperialism (going back to Hobson, Schumpeter, and Lenin, but also, more recent Marxist contributions such as David Harvey and Hardt and Negri), and cultural, anthropological and historical perspectives (such as those found under the influence of post-colonial theory). The course will also look at other ways in which the words 'empire' and 'imperialism' have been used as an analytic, such as cultural imperialism in early globalisation theory and Media or corporate empires. The aim of the course is to examine and assess in comparative frame the different kinds of analytical tools that might be applied to the study of empire.

In this course we will look at various attacks on the idea that we have free will. Some of these attacks are based on the thesis of Determinism: the thesis that the future is fixed uniquely by the past and laws of nature. This appears to undermine the idea that we freely choose our actions. We will critically examine this thesis as well as the two most prominent strategies of response: that of Compatibilism and Libertarianism. Other attacks on free will are based on the thesis of Fatalism: the thesis that future contingent truths or future facts constrain or undermine our freedom. This line of attack has a long and distinguished history, stretching back to Aristotle's sea-battle argument. We will look at various facets of this famous debate and consider how it applies to contemporary disputes.", "outcome": "Analyse the central ideas of free will and determinism.

Students will engage in depth in the analysis of the social and psychological process of social categorization into groups, the interdependencies between individuals and groups, and the cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural consequences of both social categorization and social interdependence. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to examine current understandings of group interactions (e.g., deviance, norms, & decision making), pro-social behaviours (e.g., cooperation, helping, trust, & fairness), social change and collective action, social influence, and stereotyping and prejudice. The course, itself, strongly integrates theory with laboratory and field data, allowing students to gain a solid understanding of advanced, contemporary insights into a range of social behaviours.A key feature of this course is its emphasis on the importance of theory in developing an understanding of group life. This emphasis on theory, however, is balanced by a rigorous laboratory program designed to complement the lectures, while simultaneously providing hands-on lessons in experimental social psychology. Throughout the course, students will design an experiment; complete a Human Research Ethics Application; and write a formal research report Introduction, hypothesis, Methods and Results. Students will learn key features of social-psychological experimental design, including the manipulation and measurement of variables of interest, scale construction, hypothesis testing, data interpretation, as well as abstract methodological concepts such as mediation and moderation.Critically, this course not only provides students with a supported and structured environment in which to gain a deep understanding of the social psychology of group life, but it equips students with a variety of graduate attributes (also known as employability skills) identified as important for the development of a productive workforce. Specifically, students develop an ability to communicate effectively and contribute to scholarship in social psychology; to solve problems, take individual initiative, and think critically; to understand ethical values in research; and to make sense of evidence.

From the war of decolonisation against the French to the US intervention from the early 1960s, Vietnam became one of the Cold War's 'hot wars' and a symbol of the American desire to 'contain' communism. Yet the communist victory in 1975 did not mean the end of war in mainland Southeast Asia.

Sociologists are interested in not only interpreting social patterns, but in using this insight to transform society. This is what  doing 'public sociology'  is all about. In this advanced course students will be  introduced to the notions of 'public sociology', 'action research' and 'social movements', and will explore the diverse practices that comprise each of these political and substantive projects. They will be shown the distinct ways in which sociologists have  contributed to public and policy understandings of - and responses to - key social issues such as climate change, poverty, gender relations, crime and security . Students will also be exposed to different sites of sociological engagement such as  education, research, media engagement, employment, policy lobbying, action research, protest, performance and NGO participation and the different tools required to participate in these arenas.   A key facet of this course is to develop students' comprehension of the professional 'identity' and 'project' of the sociologist, and to provide tangible resources that will enable them to influence specific social matters.

From the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, Europe experienced significant migration of peoples and witnessed the emergence of enduring political, legal and social institutions.  At the same time, divisions between and consolidation of religious institutions took place alongside the flourishing of dynamic intellectual and cultural centres, while expanding horizons to the north, south and east of Europe led to both productive and violent exchanges with peoples and places beyond the continental mainland.This course will examine the shaping of medieval Europe between c. 850 and 1300 from the twin perspectives of cultures and conflicts. To consider the important role these interlinked facets of medieval life played in shaping the European world, this course will explore a range of topics, including Viking raids and Norse settlement in Europe; Angevins and empire; crusades; Church-State conflicts; heresies and religious persecution; Mediterranean cultures; intellectual renaissances; artistic developments; and Mongol invasions.

Considering violence from an anthropological perspective foregrounds concerns of meaning, representation and symbolismunderstanding violence as expression as much as instrument. We will be approaching violence as usually meaningful and always culturally mediated, a phenomenon that is not outside the realm of human society.A key theme to be explored is the contention that violence, rather than necessarily signifying a breakdown in social existence, often plays a partperhaps even a fundamental onein the maintenance or creation of particular forms of social order. To this end, we will be concerned with analysing not only the explicit acts of bodily harm that occur in violent conflict but more subtle forms of violence perpetrated by the nation-state and global institutions. In this sense, a vital aspect of the course involves engaging with the 'anthropology of state practices' through considering the relation of state and society as this shapes occurrences and expressions of violence.Finally, we consider the relation of anthropology and anthropologists to debates about universal human rights and reflect on the position of the anthropologist in witnessing, theorising and writing about violence, as well as the methodological challenges, ethical dilemmas, dangers and responsibilities involved.", "outcome": "", "area": "ANTH", "level": "2000", "prereq_text": "To enrol in this course you must have completed 12 units of 1000 level Archaeology (ARCH) or Anthropology (ANTH) or History (HIST) or Political Science (POLS) or Sociology (SOCY) Courses.

{ "code":"PHIL1007", "title":"What is Humanity?", "description": "Philosophy has always been concerned with exploring fundamental questions about the nature of humanity, questions that still preoccupy us today and inform many of the other disciplines studied at university. This first year course aims to introduce students to philosophical reflection on questions (a) to do with 'humanity' in the sense of an ethical aspiration proper to human existence and the meaning and potential inherent in human life, and (b) how we can hold 'humanity' to be metaphysically unique, both as a civilizational achievement and as opposed to entities such as non-human animals or machines. Being human implies that we can be 'inhuman', by violating a basic ethical code that defines us. What is the status of that code and how does it inform ideas about human rights? How is the ideal of humanity linked to claims about human privilege and difference? And can ideas about the high value of what is properly human effectively license violence against other beings deemed less important or valuable? In particular the course will focus on four overlapping topic areas: humanity and rights; humanity and animals; humanity and race; and humanity and gender. Alongside philosophy, works of film and literature will inform the discussion. The course treats philosophical questions as arising out of dense problem areas, often most effectively mapped in literary treatments. Beginning from skepticism that we know what humanity is, or what it is worth, the course probes three intersectional issues - gender, race and animality - that render the practice and grasp of our 'humanity' particularly complex and demanding.", "outcome": "Understand some core areas of philosophy, particularly those concerning questions of what humanity consists in Engage in argumentation, the critical evaluation of texts, basic research and essay writing etc, as appropriate for a first year course Engage in well-reasoned, justified and articulate discussion and debate.", "area": "PHIL", "level": "1000", "prereq_text": "You are not able to enrol in this course if you have previously completed PHIL1003.", "semester":[2], "pre_req_cnf":[["~PHIL1003"]]}
