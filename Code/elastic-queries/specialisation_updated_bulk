The biomedical sciences help us understand disease, how it occurs, what happens and how we can control, cure and prevent it. These studies build on a broad foundation in the biological sciences. Basic biological principles will be applied to areas of specialisation such as physiology, anatomy, human genetics, neuroscience, immunology and infectious diseases. This specialisation provides preparation for further study in biomedical science, including medicine and allied health areas. It is also of value to a range of careers including global health and disease, laboratory research and support, pharmaceutical industry and sales, and biotechnology.Learning outcomesUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\n1. Apply their conceptual knowledge of biological principles and processes to the study of human health and disease.\n2. Solve problems and critically analyse issues using interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human structure and function at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.\n3. Explain the co-evolution of microorganisms and the mammalian immune system. Use this knowledge to understand how to control human pathogens.\n4. Develop laboratory skills in microbiology and immunology. Understand how knowledge in the field is derived. Begin to understand the boundaries and uncertainties of cutting-edge knowledge in the field.\n5. Critically evaluate experimental data and analysis based on disciplinary research and published literature.\n6.

The specialisation in Advanced Chemistry builds a more sophisticated understanding of chemical concepts across the spectrum of the discipline and in particular fosters integration of theoretical and applied knowledge across interdisciplinary and sub disciplinary contexts.Students are able to construct a pathway based on their evolving areas of interest, allowing for specialisation in several areas of chemistry including synthetic, biological, physical, material and theoretical. Students undertaking this specialisation are expected to complete at least one independent research project as they consolidate professional skills and research capabilities in a real research lab environment. This is a particularly important consideration for students contemplating pursuing Honours in the discipline.Learning Goals:On completion of a major in Chemistry and a specialisation in Advanced Chemistry students will be able to: Extend and synthesise knowledge of the structure, bonding, properties, characterisation and reactivity of molecular and macromolecular compounds and solid state materials into a range of interdisciplinary and sub disciplinary contexts. Apply chemical concepts and ideas to solve problems of a chemical nature and to the solution of real-world problems. Exercise highly developed laboratory based skills in both qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis. Prepare, isolate, purify and characterise chemical compounds and design a synthetic pathway to them based on literature precedents. Independently undertake appropriate chemical risk assessments and handle and use chemicals in a safe manner including the correct disposal of chemical wastes.

We focus on issues concerning both developed and developing nations and how population change interacts with, for example, changes in the family, health, ageing, environment and employment.

By understanding mechanisms used by pathogens to evade the immune response, and immune mechanisms used to control infectious agents and cancer, students will develop advanced knowledge in this fascinating field, highly relevant to human health. The specialisation will prepare students for professional and graduate degrees emphasizing these disciplines, and will provide a solid background for students pursuing career goals in laboratory science and public policy related to health and disease.Learning outcomesUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\n1. Distinguish and classify a range of microorganisms, with specific emphasis on bacteria, viruses and parasites and describe the life cycles, metabolism, and genetics of classes of microorganisms.\n2. Describe, in depth, immune responses, with particular reference to the organs and cells of the mammalian immune system, and how these develop, function and interact.\n3. Explain the co-evolution of microorganisms and host immune systems. Use this knowledge to understand how to control human pathogens.\n4. Apply the fundamental laboratory skills used in microbiology and immunology and understand how knowledge in the field is derived.\n5. Critically evaluate experimental data and begin to understand the boundaries and uncertainties of cutting-edge knowledge in the field.\n6. Communicate data and information in clear and effective ways to disciplinary and to non-disciplinary audiences.

The Sustainability Science specialisation builds the fundamental understandings and skills necessary to develop research projects that effectively address complex problems at the intersection of environment and society.

The study of Tetum is essential for anyone wishing to understand Timor-Leste's society, culture and history. The ANU offers the rare opportunity to complete a minor in Tetum. Timor-Leste is a close neighbour of Australia and ties between these two countries are increasing through international security, trade and development projects. Students completing a minor in Tetum will be uniquely placed to engage with the Timorese people, state, and society. The four courses needed to complete the minor are not offered on campus, but are instead available 100% online and can be studied from anywhere. Students who complete this language minor will reach an Intermediate level of Tetum skills and knowledge.A student may not take a course if that course is a prerequisite for another course which they have already passed, or a course that is a lower level than a course they have already passed.Students with prior knowledge of the language will be required to take a placement test."}},"code": "TETM-SPEC"}

You can develop expertise to: interpret quantitative surface and groundwater flow and water quality data; design assessment and monitoring programs for water resources; provide the technical results to underpin effective management strategies and policies for water resource use; evaluate water resources policy; and facilitate the nexus between water science, policy and management."},"2016": {"requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"title": "Land and Catchment Management","code": "ENVS6304"}]],"units": 6},{"type": "minimum","courses": [[{"title": "Participatory Resource Management: Working with Communities and Stakeholders","code": "ENVS6021"}],[{"title": "Ecological Assessment and Management","code": "ENVS6514"}],[{"title": "Sustainable Agricultural Systems","code": "ENVS6223"}]],"units": 6},{"type": "maximum","courses": [[{"title": "Water Science","code": "ENVS6022"}],[{"title": "Biodiversity Conservation","code": "ENVS6024"}],[{"title": "Managing Forested Landscapes","code": "ENVS6026"}],[{"title": "Fire in the Environment","code": "ENVS6308"}],[{"title": "Water Management","code": "ENVS6555"}],[{"title": "Environmental Measurement, Modelling and Monitoring","code": "ENVS6202"}],[{"title": "Severe Weather","code": "ENVS6311"}]],"units": 12}]},"learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will have the knowledge and skills to: 1. Analyse critically information about the distribution, quality and use of water resources in Australia, the Australasian region and the world, and apply this to the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data relevant to water quantity and quality 2. Develop the cognitive, technical and creative skills to develop quantitative predictions relevant for surface water and groundwater budgets and flow 3. Critically reflect on and evaluate the impacts of climate, land use, and agricultural, commercial and industrial activity on the quality of surface water and groundwater, including interactions with biology, atmosphere, regolith and rocks 4.
