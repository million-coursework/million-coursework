All key areas, such as cognition, language, emotion, social and motor skills will be discussed. The biological foundations of psychological development and the psychoanalystical, behavioural and cognitive theories which provide the basis of modern developmental psychology provide an underlying integrative thread. The effects of work and retirement, and health-care provision on promoting healthy ageing will be addressed within the context of the processes of human health and diseasethe laboratory program will provide students with more in depth information about specific aspects of human development, and how developmental theories, methods and research findings are inherently linked to provide and empirical basis for the discipline.Learning Goals: Students who have completed the Developmental Psychology minor will be able to: Explain major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology. Differentiate theoretical and empirical frameworks that have defined and shaped the field. Define key concepts that characterise psychology as a field of scientific inquiry as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines. Relate how social (eg environmental/cultural), and biological (genes, hormones) factors jointly shape human behavior. Apply basic research methods in psychology to investigate psychological questions and to research design, data analysis, and interpretation. Use critical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes. Identify relevant psychological mechanisms/issues and apply to real world or other contexts. Apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organisational issues. Critically analyse data and research, including methodology, results and conclusions. Articulate some of the central questions and issues in contemporary psychology. Critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in the popular media. Identify and critically evaluate appropriate disciplinary research sources Evaluate information from a statistical perspective drawing on basic statistical concepts. Develop competence in interpreting graphical data to understand what is being compared/manipulated (independent variables) and what is being measured (dependent variables). Clearly communicate psychological processes and principles to both science literate and non science literate audiences. Adapt the collaborative and independent experiences of psychology laboratory, project and course work to other contexts. Identify and reflect on the values that underpin the discipline of psychology and its practice.","title": "Developmental Psychology","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "PSYC1004","title": "Psychology 2: Understanding People in Context"}],[{"code": "PSYC2002","title": "Developmental Psychology"}],[{"code": "PSYC3020","title": "Health Psychology"}],[{"code": "PSYC3027","title": ""}]],"units": 24}]}}},"level": "undergraduate"}

What happens when theatre and/or print texts are adapted for cinematic and/or televisual screens? And how is cinema transforming over time, including in the context of new interactive, digital media? These and other questions are among the many you'll explore in doing Film Studies at the ANU. Learning OutcomesOn completion of the Film minor a student will have: proficiency in close analysis of film across a range of genres and contexts acquired knowledge of the diverse historical and cultural contexts in which film has been produced and received capacity to understand film as both reflecting and shaping various cultural, historical and national contexts proficiencies in critical inquiry, interpretation and evaluation, argument and written expression knowledge and skills to undertake further study","title": "Film","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "FILM1002","title": "Introduction to Film Studies"}]],"units": 6,"type": "maximum"},{"courses": [[{"code": "ANCH2021","title": "Ancient World in Film"}],[{"code": "ARCH2052","title": "Archaeology in Film and Fiction"}],[{"code": "ASIA2080","title": "Korean Film: History, Culture and Society"}],[{"code": "ENGL2055","title": "Shakespeare and Film"}],[{"code": "ENGL2067","title": "Novel into Film"}],[{"code": "ENGL2116","title": "Televisual: Investigating Narrative Television"}],[{"code": "FILM2005","title": "Moving Pictures: Cinema and the Visual Arts"}],[{"code": "FILM2006","title": "United States Cinema: Hollywood and Beyond"}],[{"code": "FILM2012","title": "German Film Since the Wall: Identity, History and Belonging"}],[{"code": "FILM2013","title": "Cinema from the Spanish-speaking World"}],[{"code": "FILM2014","title": "Imagining the French Empire: French Colonialism on Film"}],[{"code": "FILM2066","title": "Australian Cinema: The Kelly Gang to Baz Luhrmann's Australia"}],[{"code": "FREN3108","title": "Imagining the French Empire: French Colonialism on Film"}],[{"code": "GEND2021","title": "Trauma, Memory and Culture"}],[{"code": "GERM2113","title": "German Film Since the Wall: Identity, History and Belonging"}]],"units": 18,"type": "minimum"}]}},"2019": {"title": "Film"},"2014": {"description": "Film in all its genres and formats, from celluloid to the new media worlds of digital FX, continues to be a leading art form and a major means of communication of our time.

{"code": "FORA-MIN","versions": {"2018": {"description": "Forensic anthropology is rapidly developing a high profile both internationally and domestically. Much of this interest has been catalysed by way of media coverage of investigations into crimes against humanity and unsolved murders. Australians have been involved in such work recently with respect to East Timor and the Solomon Islands in particular.Forensic anthropology, as a discipline, is primarily concerned with developing and applying a range of anthropological and archaeological skills to questions of medico-legal importance. Traditionally the subject is broken down into three main sub-fields: (1) forensic osteology; (2) forensic archaeology; and (3) forensic taphonomy. Forensic osteology uses methods and procedures developed in physical anthropology and focuses on human identification by way of the analysis of physical remains (skeletal and dental material in general).

All courses, right from the Introductory level, emphasise the importance of culture, history, politics and society. The aim is to have students gain fluency in French together with a background knowledge of France, both in its European and overseas context, particularly the Pacific. To this end, we use a variety of material drawn from written, audio-visual and electronic sources. We encourage students to study for part of their degree at a French-speaking university, once they are proficient enough. Honours students normally spend a semester abroad. We have exchange agreements with several French universities, including in the Pacific (Noumea, Tahiti), with Canada: (McGill University, Montreal; the bilingual University of Ottawa) and with Switzerland (University of Geneva). Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement. Students are advised to check prerequisites carefully and plan their minor accordingly. Learning outcomes On successful completion of the French Language & Culture minor all students will have gained general fluency in oral and written expression as well as in aural and reading comprehension. Fluency covers expression in different registers from everyday language use to academic language. Students will have developed the ability to express themselves orally and in writing in different genres. Students will have gained substantial knowledge on key aspects of French culture, history, politics and society. They will be able to interpret critically French and Francophone literary texts, movies and visual-media Students will have gained intercultural awareness. They will be able to critically compare and reflect on cross-cultural difference between Francophone and Australian cultures and/or their native culture. At the end of a French Language & Culture minor students should be able to achieve the B1 or B2 level of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) depending on their results. Exceptional students with or without extensive prior knowledge of French before they start their major could achieve the C1 level. Students will be able to conduct research on a topic related to the French language and its associated cultures, and to write an essay on their research outcomes.","title": "French Language and Culture","requirements": {"x_from_category": [{"units": 6,"area": ["LANG"],"type": "maximum"}],"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "FREN1003","title": "Introductory French I"}],[{"code": "FREN1004","title": "Introductory French II"}],[{"code": "FREN2024","title": "Continuing French I"}],[{"code": "FREN2025","title": "Continuing French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3006","title": "Intermediate French I"}],[{"code": "FREN3007","title": "Intermediate French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3008","title": "Advanced French Topics"}],[{"code": "FREN3106","title": "Current affairs and the French Press"}]],"units": 12,"type": "minimum"},{"courses": [[{"code": "FREN2021","title": "Selected Topics in French Studies"}],[{"code": "FREN2023","title": "French Cinema"}],[{"code": "FREN2026","title": "New Caledonia: Field Work and Research"}],[{"code": "FREN3105","title": ""}]],"units": 12,"type": "maximum"}]}},"2017": {"description": "The French Language and Culture minor aims at developing students' ability to understand, pronounce and speak standard French and to read and write French as it appears in newspapers, magazines, media, cinema and literature.

These fields of study recognise that heritage finds expression not only in material culture, but also in intangible cultural events and performances, and that heritage is intimately linked to expressions of identity, sense of place and the processes of remembering, forgetting and commemoration. This program endeavours to expand understanding about the purposes for which heritage and museums have been employed by stakeholder and audience groups ranging from local communities or agencies, to state and national governments, and international policy frameworks. It develops an integrated understanding of the way heritage is managed and exhibited with critical explorations of the cultural and political work that heritage does in society. The minor will be particularly relevant to students in archaeology, anthropology, history, fine arts, environmental sciences and related disciplines and who may wish to consider a career in the heritage and museum sectors. The minor examines not only conceptual and theoretical issues that have impact onheritage and museum policy and practice, but also provides some exposure to practical management and curatorial issues.","title": "Heritage and Museum Studies","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion of this minor, students will be able to: \n1.

The major is interdisciplinary, in which it is possible to combine courses from anthropology, archaeology, art, art history, history, linguistics, music, and gender sexuality and culture for a broadly based understanding of Indigenous Australian societies and cultures, both past and present. Taken together the courses provide a comprehensive insight into Indigenous Australian studies, including Aboriginal origins, their occupation and adaption to the continent, their traditional and contemporary, social cultural, artistic, musical and linguistic practices, the impact of European colonisation, the history of the interrelationship between Aboriginal people and other Australians, the place of Indigenous people in Australian society today, and issues of representation. Learning outcomesAn understanding of why Aboriginal societies and cultures have been so important in the history of European social theoryA knowledge of the diversity of Indigenous societies and cultures prior to colonisationAn ability to locate developments in Indigenous Visual Art in the broader contexts of political, social and International Visual cultureAn ability to assess much of the public discourse around Aboriginal cultureAn understanding of the public debates and reporting of issues in Indigenous affairs in Australia and an ability to deconstruct themA knowledge of the place and significance of language in Indigenous culturesAn understandings of how attitudes to Aboriginal history have changed over time, in response both to a changing political climate and the impact of Indigenous perspectives on historical writing.","title": "Indigenous Australian Studies","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "ANTH1004","title": "Introduction to Indigenous Australian Studies"}],[{"code": "AUST1001","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian Language"}],[{"code": "INDG1001","title": "Indigenous Peoples, Populations and Communities"}]],"units": 12,"type": "minimum"},{"courses": [[{"code": "ANTH2005","title": "Indigenous Australian Societies and Cultures"}],[{"code": "ARCH2004","title": "Australian Archaeology"}],[{"code": "HUMN2051","title": "Introduction to Cultural Heritage Management"}],[{"code": "ARTH2098","title": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art"}],[{"code": "ARTV2021","title": "Indigenous Australian Visual Culture"}],[{"code": "AUST2008","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian language 2"}],[{"code": "GEND2021","title": "Trauma, Memory and Culture"}]],"units": 6,"type": "minimum"}]}}},"level": "undergraduate"}

It continued to be used by China's governing and elite cultures for nearly three millennia. A command of Literary Chinese is therefore indispensable for the study of any aspect of Chinese literature, thought, history, politics, or society before the twentieth century.The idioms, syntax, style, and allusions of Literary Chinese continue to pervade the modern language. Its enduring influence results from the fact that the great legacies of Chinese culture, right down to the present day, have been largely preserved in this medium. Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. Texts written in Literary Chinese have also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.The Literary Chinese Minor offers a way into these rich worlds, past and present, through their primary sources. It begins with an introduction to the main sentence patterns and grammatical features of texts from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods. It expands its focus to texts from different periods of the imperial era. It culminates with close study of the registers of language specific to a range of different types of text. Throughout, the focus is on philological translation. The Minor therefore introduces students to the Sinological reference tools and the contextual knowledge necessary for a full appreciation of the texts under study.Entry requirements for the MinorStudents who wish to enter the Minor will be required to take a language placement test to demonstrate knowledge of the Chinese script as well as the basic grammar and structures of the written language at a level of competence equivalent to the learning outcomes of CHIN2023 or JPNS300\n2.","title": "Literary Chinese","learning_outcomes": "On satisfying the requirements of the Literary Chinese Minor, students will have the knowledge and skills to: 1. Hypothesise on, analyse, and appraise vocabulary used in different types of Literary Chinese text, with the use of general and specialist dictionaries. 2. Identify and analyse the grammar and sentence structures evident in Literary Chinese texts from pre-imperial and imperial times; and consider their contributions to stylistic and other effects. 3. Analyse linguistic registers used in texts written in complex forms of Literary Chinese and reproduce them in appropriate registers of English. 4. Use commentaries to assess different readings of the text at hand, supporting translations with an understanding of commentarial techniques and vocabulary. 5. Produce a creative response to the text through the composition of a critical apparatus and a detailed analysis of textual references and literary allusions, through the use of reference tools specific to the type of text at hand; and develop an appreciation of the text in its relevant social, intellectual, and cultural contexts.","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "CHIN2019","title": "Literary Chinese 1"}],[{"code": "CHIN2021","title": "Literary Chinese 2"}],[{"code": "CHIN3015","title": "Advanced Literary Chinese"}]],"units": 24}]}},"2019": {"description": "Literary Chinese is a written language that matured long before the Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.), when China first became an empire.

Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. Texts written in Literary Chinese have also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.The Literary Chinese Minor offers a way into these rich worlds, past and present, through their primary sources. It begins with an introduction to the main sentence patterns and grammatical features of texts from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods. It expands its focus to texts from different periods of the imperial era. It culminates with close study of the registers of language specific to a range of different types of text. Throughout, the focus is on philological translation. The Minor therefore introduces students to the Sinological reference tools and the contextual knowledge necessary for a full appreciation of the texts under study.Entry requirements for the MinorStudents who wish to enter the Minor will be required to take a language placement test to demonstrate knowledge of the Chinese script as well as the basic grammar and structures of the written language at a level of competence equivalent to the learning outcomes of CHIN2023 or JPNS300\n2.","title": "Literary Chinese","learning_outcomes": "On satisfying the requirements of the Literary Chinese Minor, students will have the knowledge and skills to: 1. Hypothesise on, analyse, and appraise vocabulary used in different types of Literary Chinese text, with the use of general and specialist dictionaries. 2. Identify and analyse the grammar and sentence structures evident in Literary Chinese texts from pre-imperial and imperial times; and consider their contributions to stylistic and other effects. 3. Analyse linguistic registers used in texts written in complex forms of Literary Chinese and reproduce them in appropriate registers of English. 4. Use commentaries to assess different readings of the text at hand, supporting translations with an understanding of commentarial techniques and vocabulary. 5. Produce a creative response to the text through the composition of a critical apparatus and a detailed analysis of textual references and literary allusions, through the use of reference tools specific to the type of text at hand; and develop an appreciation of the text in its relevant social, intellectual, and cultural contexts.","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "CHIN2019","title": "Literary Chinese 1"}],[{"code": "CHIN2021","title": "Literary Chinese 2"}],[{"code": "CHIN3015","title": "Advanced Literary Chinese"}]],"units": 24}]}}},"level": "undergraduate"}

Learning outcomesStudents who complete this minor will have the skills and knowledge to:closely analyse and critique arguments in a wide variety of fields and contexts, which may include using formal logic.develop cogent arguments and presentations, including engaging with detailed criticism of their ideas.apply complex abstract ideas to real-world phenomena in a wide variety of fields and contexts.recognise implicit epistemological and ontological assumptions in social, political, scientific, moral, and cultural arguments and positions, and relate them to contesting ideas and real-world scenarios.describe western philosophical traditions and their history.","title": "Philosophy","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "MATH1042","title": "Philosophy of the Cosmos"}],[{"code": "PHIL1004","title": "Fundamental Ideas in Philosophy: An Introduction"}],[{"code": "PHIL1005","title": "Logic and Critical Thinking"}],[{"code": "PHIL1007","title": "Philosophy, Society, Humanity"}]],"units": 12,"type": "maximum"},{"courses": [[{"code": "ASIA2054","title": "Chinese Philosophy: Creation and Development"}],[{"code": "PHIL2012","title": "Topics in Buddhist Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL2016","title": "Philosophy of Language"}],[{"code": "PHIL2020","title": "Theories of Social Justice"}],[{"code": "PHIL2042","title": "Philosophy of the Cosmos"}],[{"code": "PHIL2057","title": "Philosophy of Science"}],[{"code": "PHIL2059","title": "Love Death and Freedom (20th Century French Phenomenology)"}],[{"code": "PHIL2060","title": "Contemporary Metaphysics"}],[{"code": "PHIL2061","title": "Philosophy of Psychology"}],[{"code": "PHIL2064","title": "Theories of Ethics"}],[{"code": "PHIL2065","title": "Politics and Rights"}],[{"code": "PHIL2074","title": "Modern Theories of Knowledge"}],[{"code": "PHIL2080","title": "Logic"}],[{"code": "PHIL2082","title": "Sex and Death: the Philosophy of Biology"}],[{"code": "PHIL2085","title": "Applied Ethics"}],[{"code": "PHIL2087","title": "Nietzsche"}],[{"code": "PHIL2092","title": "Philosophy of The Enlightenment"}],[{"code": "PHIL2094","title": "Themes from Wittgenstein"}],[{"code": "PHIL2097","title": "European Philosophy B"}],[{"code": "PHIL2100","title": "Origins of Analytical Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL2101","title": "Democracy, Difference and Desire"}],[{"code": "PHIL2102","title": "Film as Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL2110","title": "Social Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL2111","title": "Global Citizens"}],[{"code": "PHIL2113","title": "Global Justice"}],[{"code": "PHIL2114","title": "Sustainability, System and Agency"}],[{"code": "PHIL2115","title": "Political Philosophy from Hobbes to Mill"}],[{"code": "PHIL3062","title": "Advanced Philosophical Topics A"}],[{"code": "PHIL3063","title": "Advanced Philosophical Topics B"}],[{"code": "PHIL3070","title": "Reason, Critique and the Self: Kant and German Idealism"}],[{"code": "PHIL3071","title": "Advanced Continental Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL3072","title": "Advanced Analytic Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL3073","title": "Advanced Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy"}],[{"code": "POLS2063","title": "Contemporary Political Theory"}],[{"code": "POLS2102","title": "The Political Philosophy of Deception"}],[{"code": "PHIL2119","title": "Foundations of Modern Philosophy"}],[{"code": "PHIL2120","title": "Towards a Critique of Political Economy: the Young Marx on Work, Property and Emancipation"}]],"units": 12,"type": "minimum"}]}}},"level": "undergraduate"}

{"code": "SEAS-MIN","versions": {"2018": {"description": "DescriptionSoutheast Asia is known for its role as an economic hub, as well as its political and cultural diversity. Students in the Southeast Asian Studies minor at ANU have access to a wide range of scholars and courses on language, history, cultures, and politics in the region. By completing coursework as prescribed by the minor, students will gain a deeper understanding of regional issues, such as power, globalization, ethnicity and gender, as well as processes and issues specific to their country or area of interest. These can include religious systems, economic networks and cross-cultural contact.

Emphasis is placed on the social forces and constraints which influence the way both small groups and large institutions work. By studying sociology, students learn to understand how individuals and groups shape and are shaped by their social world. Additionally, students learn methodologies and techniques that help them, as independent researchers, in developing skills necessary to study social change.Learning outcomesCompletion of this minor will enable students to: Understand key dimensions of social experience such as ethnicity, class, gender, age, sexual preference, religion, and nationality. Use sociological concepts to understand and interpret social issues. Develop more advanced reading, information literacy, research, presentation and writing skills.","title": "Sociology","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"courses": [[{"code": "SOCY1002","title": "Self and Society"}],[{"code": "SOCY1004","title": "Introduction to Social Psychology"}]],"units": 12},{"courses": [[{"code": "GEND2023","title": "Gender, Sex and Sexuality: An Introduction to Feminist Theory"}],[{"code": "GEND2025","title": "Gender, Health and Embodiment"}],[{"code": "GEND2026","title": "Technoculture and the Body"}],[{"code": "POLS2096","title": "Genocide Studies"}],[{"code": "POLS2100","title": "Genocide - Post 1945"}],[{"code": "DEMO2001","title": "Population Studies"}],[{"code": "DEMO2002","title": "Population Analysis"}],[{"code": "SOCY2008","title": "Risks, Hazards and Disasters"}],[{"code": "SOCY2021","title": "Education and Society"}],[{"code": "SOCY2022","title": "Environmental Sociology"}],[{"code": "SOCY2026","title": "Excessive Appetites: Sociocultural Perspectives on Addiction, Drug Use and Gender"}],[{"code": "SOCY2030","title": "Sociology of Third World Development"}],[{"code": "SOCY2038","title": "Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods"}],[{"code": "SOCY2040","title": "Classical Sociological Theory"}],[{"code": "SOCY2043","title": "Qualitative Research Methods"}],[{"code": "SOCY2053","title": "Imagining the Future: The Social Origins of Utopias and Science Fiction"}],[{"code": "SOCY2055","title": "Social Inequality in Comparative Perspective"}],[{"code": "SOCY2057","title": "Relationships, Marriage and Family"}],[{"code": "CRIM2001","title": "Doing Criminology: Research Methods in Crime and Criminal Justice"}],[{"code": "SOCY2059","title": "Sociology of Resistance"}],[{"code": "SOCY2060","title": "Mobile Societies"}],[{"code": "SOCY2061","title": "Contemporary Chinese Society"}],[{"code": "CRIM2004","title": "Dimensions of Crime: Identifying and Controlling Offenders"}],[{"code": "SOCY2063","title": "Corruption in our world"}]],"units": 12}]}}},"level": "undergraduate"}

With global population expected to reach nine billion by 2050 our capacity to develop sustainably is even more urgent, though progress to date has been patchy.
