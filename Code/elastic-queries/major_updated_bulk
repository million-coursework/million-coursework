Students develop the analytical skills necessary for viewing at images and objects with a critical eye, selective reading, and the ability to communicate effectively about works in different media, including their own, to specialist audiences using professional conventions. 1000-level courses are held at the National Gallery of Australia, providing students with a rich learning environment and direct access to works in the National Collection. Art Theory is located within the studio-based environment of the School of Art.

{"code": "CMBI-MAJ","versions": {"2017": {"description": "This major covers the study of life processes at the molecular and cellular levels, including the storage, transfer and regulation of genetic information, the structure and function of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and interactions between molecules and cells. The emphasis is on basic principles that underpin the processes unique to living organisms at the molecular and cellular levels. The concepts and techniques of molecular and cell biology form the foundation for studies of all aspects of modern biology and will be applied to different areas such as biomedical science, plant science, developmental biology and microbiology. This major provides a solid grounding for further study in any area of the molecular life sciences as well as medicine, bioengineering and biotechnology.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: Demonstrate and apply knowledge of how biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology are used to elucidate the functions of molecules and cells Integrate and extend their conceptual knowledge of the structure and function of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as whole entities and in terms of their subcellular and molecular processes Explain how biology is an evidence-based discipline involving observation, experimentation and hypothesis testing and how it relates to other scientific disciplines. Develop and implement experimental strategies to investigate different biological and experimental systems and analyse and present results of these investigations. Critically assess biological information and apply it to theoretical, experimental and professional contexts. Employ their collaborative and independent educational experiences of laboratory, project and coursework in other contexts. Clearly communicate biological processes and principles to both science literate and non-science literate audiences.

Students intending to pursue further studies in computing should do a double major.Excellent career opportunities exist for Computer Science graduates in business, industry and government as programmers, systems analysts, computer systems and network managers, user support officers and software engineers.Learning Goals:Students who complete the Computer Science major be able to:Understand the basic principles and theory used in developing computational solutions to problems. These include the ability to use formal notations and the use of the principle of abstraction.Apply a range of skills to analyse problems and construct a reliable computational solution. This includes the identification of requirements, separation of concerns, and testing.Understand the connections between computing and other disciplines, and recognize computational ideas embedded in other contexts.Apply independent learning and reasoning in the computing discipline; this includes an awareness of current research issues. This is done through reading of textbooks, papers and and electronic resources.Work in both independent and collaborative ways with others; relate professional and disciplinary information and ideas to diverse audiences in effective and appropriate ways; but at the same time be responsible for individual work and aware of plagiarism issues.Apply in-depth knowledge and competencies in advanced areas of the computing discipline.","title": "Computer Science","requirements": {"x_from_here": [{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "COMP2600","title": "Formal Methods in Software Engineering"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "COMP1100","title": "Introduction to Programming and Algorithms"}],[{"code": "COMP1130","title": "Introduction to Programming and Algorithms (Advanced)"}],[{"code": "COMP1730","title": "Programming for Scientists"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "COMP1110","title": "Introduction to Software Systems"}],[{"code": "COMP1140","title": "Introduction to Software Systems (Advanced)"}]]},{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "COMP2100","title": "Software Construction"}],[{"code": "COMP2300","title": "Introduction to Computer Systems"}]]}]}},"2018": {"description": "Computer Science is the study of information and computation: of algorithms, data and computing systems which accept, store, transform and present data in ways that contribute to knowledge and the well-being of society.The computer science major teaches the basic principles and theory used in developing computational solutions to problems including a study of data structures, algorithms, and programming languages and their use in translating solutions into software systems.Example applications include the world-wide web, databases, user-interfaces, networks, high-performance computing, computer control and real-time systems.

Since then agencies and government officials, practitioners and intellectuals have debated the rights and wrongs of development and the merits of particular approaches to development. These have crystallised in various 'theories' or approaches to development, such as the modernisation theories, world system theories, or the more recent emphasis on empowerment, popular participation and sustainable development.Development Studies examines the impact of globalisation on states and peoples of the South, and reviews notions of economic viability, democracy, governance, human rights or environmental sustainability as they apply to such culturally divergent entities. In the last two decades there has been an explosion in the numbers of non-government organisations (NGOs) or voluntary organisations (VOs) also concentrating on development.","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1.

It focuses on how key areas of environmental science relate to and are underpinned by landscape processes. Only by understanding these key landscape processes can successful environmental outcomes be achieved. The major includes a focus on current understandings of the science of the environment, and a range of response strategies for their sustainable management. Students develop their ability to evaluate recent and current advances in environmental science, and in policy and management approaches; and to integrate a range of discipline-based knowledge relevant to specific regions or issues in sustainable environmental and landscape management Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: Think critically about environmental science issues, integrate information, and construct logical, consistent and synthesised arguments.

{"code": "FREN-MAJ","versions": {"2014": {"description": "This major aims at developing students' ability to understand, pronounce and speak standard French and to read and write French as it appears in newspapers, magazines, media, cinema and literature. All courses, right from the Introductory level, emphasise the importance of culture, history, politics and society. The aim is to have students gain fluency in French together with a background knowledge of France, both in its European and overseas context, particularly the Pacific. To this end, we use a variety of material drawn from written, audio-visual and electronic sources. We encourage students to study for part of their degree at a French-speaking university, once they are proficient enough. Honours students normally spend a semester abroad. We have exchange agreements with several French universities, including in the Pacific (Noumea, Tahiti), with Canada: (McGill University, Montreal; the bilingual University of Ottawa) and with Switzerland (University of Geneva). Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. Students beginning this major at introductory level follow a different pathway to complete the major.Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesOn successful completion of the French Language & Culture Major all students will have gained general fluency in oral and written expression as well as in aural and reading comprehension. Fluency covers expression in different registers from everyday language use to academic language. Students will have developed the ability to express themselves orally and in writing in different genres. Students will have gained substantial knowledge on key aspects of French culture, history, politics and society. They will be able to interpret critically French and Francophone literary texts, movies and visual-media Students will have gained intercultural awareness. They will be able to critically compare and reflect on cross-cultural differences between Francophone and Australian cultures and/or their native culture.At the end of a French Language & Culture Major students should be able to achieve the B1 or B2 level of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) depending on their results. Exceptional students with or without extensive prior knowledge of French before they start their major could achieve the C1 level.","title": "French Language and Culture","requirements": {"x_from_category": [{"units": 12,"area": ["LANG"],"type": "maximum"}],"x_from_here": [{"units": 36,"courses": [[{"code": "FREN1003","title": "Introductory French I"}],[{"code": "FREN1004","title": "Introductory French II"}],[{"code": "FREN2024","title": "Continuing French I"}],[{"code": "FREN2025","title": "Continuing French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3006","title": "Intermediate French I"}],[{"code": "FREN3007","title": "Intermediate French II"}]]},{"units": 12,"courses": [[{"code": "FREN2021","title": "Selected Topics in French Studies"}],[{"code": "FREN2023","title": "French Cinema"}],[{"code": "FREN2026","title": "New Caledonia: Field Work and Research"}],[{"code": "FREN3008","title": "Advanced French Topics"}],[{"code": "FREN3105","title": ""}],[{"code": "FREN3106","title": "Current affairs and the French Press"}]]},{"units": 12,"courses": [[{"code": "FREN3008","title": "Advanced French Topics"}],[{"code": "FREN3106","title": "Current affairs and the French Press"}]]},{"units": 24,"type": "minimum","courses": [[{"code": "FREN2024","title": "Continuing French I"}],[{"code": "FREN2025","title": "Continuing French II"}],[{"code": "FREN3006","title": "Intermediate French I"}],[{"code": "FREN3007","title": "Intermediate French II"}],[{"code": "FREN2021","title": "Selected Topics in French Studies"}],[{"code": "FREN2023","title": "French Cinema"}],[{"code": "FREN2026","title": "New Caledonia: Field Work and Research"}],[{"code": "FREN3105","title": ""}]]}]}},"2016": {"description": "The French Language and Culture major aims at developing students' ability to understand, pronounce and speak standard French and to read and write French as it appears in newspapers, magazines, media, cinema and literature.

All courses, right from the Introductory level, emphasise the importance of culture, history, politics and society. The aim is to have students gain fluency in French and develop their knowledge of France, both in its European and global contexts (e.g., Africa, Asia, North America and the Pacific). To this end, we use a variety of material drawn from written, audio-visual and electronic sources. We encourage students to study for part of their degree at a French-speaking university, once they are proficient enough. It is standard practice for Honours students to spend a semester abroad. The ANU has exchange agreements with universities across the French-speaking world: France: several universities in metropolitan France; also in the French Pacific (Noumea, Tahiti); Canada: universities in Quebec (McGill University; Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) and the bilingual Universit\u00e9 d'Ottawa; Switzerland (Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve). Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. The pathways to the French Language and Culture Major depend on the entry level. These pathways are listed below. Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement for all students having had previous exposure to the language. IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors.

visual-media;\n3. critically compare and reflect on cross-cultural differences between Francophone and Australian cultures and/or their native culture (intercultural awareness); and\n4. achieve at

Students can choose from courses in German language, linguistics, literature, society and film. The exact sequence of courses depends on the student's language proficiency when beginning with the major. Students are encouraged to study abroad and take advantage of exchange agreements with partner universities in Germany and Austria. Some scholarships are available.German is the most commonly spoken first language in the European Union, being spoken by about 100 million people in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. With a rich literary and philosophical heritage, German is a language of culture, science, technology, trade and international relations. This role has increased since Germany's reunification which is reflected in Berlin having become a centre of global youth culture (\u201cBerlin ist cool!\u201d).Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement. Students commencing at introductory level follow a different pathway to complete the major.Students are advised to check prerequisites carefully and plan their major accordingly. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesOn successful completion, students will have a range of language enabling them to express viewpoints and develop arguments without much searching for words, using some complex sentence forms to do so. Students who begin the German Language & Culture Major without prior knowledge in the language can expect to achieve approximately the B2 level of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).

India lies just over the horizon of most Australians' perceptions, but the coming rise of this massive nation and its concomitant importance for Australia means that a knowledge of Hindi will be economically invaluable in the very near future.Students in this major are encouraged to spend time studying at a tertiary institution in India through a year of study in the flagship Year in Asia program. Competitive scholarships are available to qualified students.A student may not take a course if that course is a prerequisite for another course which they have already passed.

{"code": "ICOM-MAJ","versions": {"2014": {"description": "In the contemporary globalised world, where the tempo and intensity of international contacts are continually strengthening, international communication has become increasingly crucial. This interdisciplinary major is intended to help students understand cross-cultural and cross-linguistic issues involved in international communication and a working knowledge of another language.International communication is inseparable from intercultural communication - in the era of 'global English' more than ever, since one 'international English' can conceal deep differences in cultural assumptions and understandings. This major will introduce students to issues involved in interaction between speakers from different language backgrounds and equip them with conceptual tools to explore those issues.The major will include either two years of language study (for beginners) or one year of language study (for non-beginners), one compulsory course (for everyone), and for beginners one other course from a list of eight and for non-beginners three other courses from the same list. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesOn satisfying the requirements of this minor, the students will be able to:demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the complex and multifaceted relations between communication, culture, language and identity;demonstrate an understanding of the limits of translatability of key concepts across languages, and the implications of these limits for international communication;analyse cultural assumptions underlying expressions such as \u201cthe ideals of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law\u201d (Obama 2006: p. 284) and explain their linguistic underpinnings;explain the sources of miscommunication between speakers of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds who communicate using English as a lingua franca;demonstrate an understanding of potential sources of miscommunication within multilingual and multi-cultural societies such as Australia.Students will have working knowledge of another language sufficient for effective communication in many contexts and for good understanding of the issues that can arise in international communication due to linguistic differences.","title": "International Communication","requirements": {"max_by_level": [{"units": 12,"level": [1000],"type": "maximum"}],"x_from_here": [{"units": 6,"courses": [[{"code": "LING2021","title": "Cross Cultural Communication (L)"}]]},{"units": 12,"type": "minimum","courses": [[{"code": "ASIA1001","title": "Language in Asia"}],[{"code": "ASIA2001","title": "Language in Asia"}],[{"code": "HUMN2001","title": "Hashtag humanities: text and beyond in the digital age"}],[{"code": "LANG2103","title": "Acquiring Pragmatics of a Second Language"}],[{"code": "LANG3001","title": "Translation across Languages: the translation of literary texts"}],[{"code": "LANG3002","title": "Translation across Languages: specialised material"}],[{"code": "LANG3003","title": "European Narrative"}],[{"code": "LANG3004","title": "Language and Society in Latin America"}],[{"code": "LANG3005","title": "Language and Identity in a European Context"}],[{"code": "LANG3040","title": "Critical Readings for Translators"}],[{"code": "LING2015","title": "Language, Culture, Translation"}],[{"code": "LING2022","title": "Language Policy and Language Politics"}],[{"code": "LING2027","title": "Language and Society in Latin America"}],[{"code": "LING2103","title": "Language Power and Identity"}],[{"code": "AUST1001","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian Language"}],[{"code": "AUST2008","title": "Learning an Indigenous Australian language 2"}]]},{"units": 6,"type": "maximum","courses": [[{"code": "ANTH1003","title": "Global and Local"}],[{"code": "ANTH2049","title": "Filming Cultures"}],[{"code": "ANTH2129","title": "Crossing Borders: Diasporas and Transnationalism"}],[{"code": "HIST2121","title": "Electric Citizens: The Rise of the Modern Media in the United States, 1865-2000"}],[{"code": "INDN3007","title": ""}],[{"code": "PHIL2111","title": "Global Citizens"}],[{"code": "SOCY3022","title": "Identity, Difference and Ethnicity"}]]}]}},"2016": {"description": "In the contemporary globalised world, where the tempo and intensity of international contacts are continually strengthening, international communication has become increasingly crucial.

contacts are continually strengthening, international communication has become increasingly crucial. This interdisciplinary major is intended to help students understand cross-cultural and cross-linguistic issues involved in international communication and a working knowledge of another language.International communication is inseparable from intercultural communication - in the era of 'global English' more than ever, since one 'international English' can conceal deep differences in cultural assumptions and understandings. This major will introduce students to issues involved in interaction between speakers from different language backgrounds and equip them with conceptual tools to explore those issues.The major will include either two years of language study (for beginners) or one year of language study (for non-beginners), one compulsory course (for everyone), and for beginners one other course from a list of eight and for non-beginners three other courses from the same.","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1. demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the complex and multifaceted relations between communication, culture, language and identity;\n2. demonstrate an understanding of the limits of translatability of key concepts across languages, and the implications of these limits for international communication;\n3. analyse cultural assumptions underlying expressions such as \u201cthe ideals of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law\u201d (Obama 2006: p. 284) and explain their linguistic underpinnings;\n4. explain the sources of miscommunication between speakers of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds who communicate using English as a lingua franca;\n5. demonstrate an understanding of potential sources of miscommunication within multilingual and multi-cultural societies such as Australia.\n6. Students will have working knowledge of another language sufficient for effective communication in many contexts and for good understanding of the issues that can arise in international communication due to linguistic differences.\n Relevant Degrees 7.

Studying Japanese as a major can have many linguistic and cultural benefits that reach well beyond the classroom.Students in this major are encouraged to spend time studying at one of the twenty five tertiary institution in Japan with which the ANU has ties. This can be done either through intensive in-country study in the summer break, through the semester in Japan program, or through a year of study in the Year in Japan program. Competitive scholarships are available to qualified students.A student may not take a course if that course is a prerequisite for another course which they have already passed.

Linguists study languages from various points of view, including structure, acquisition, evolution and function in society. There are special branches of linguistics devoted to different aspects of languages, such as their sounds (phonetics and phonology), sentence structures (syntax), conversation and text structures (discourse), and the meanings they convey (semantics).Of the courses taught by the Program, some are devoted to the theory and methods, while others deal with a variety of applied issues, such as language policy and language teaching.In these courses, students are exposed to data from a wide variety of languages and may do detailed work on a number of different languages and language families. Thorough training is given in linguistic theory and its application to a variety of empirical problems. Attention is also directed to research methods, the application of linguistics to language teaching, language planning and socio-linguistic issues.

Linguists study languages from various points of view, including structure, acquisition, evolution and function in society. There are special branches of linguistics devoted to different aspects of languages, such as their sounds (phonetics and phonology), sentence structures (syntax), conversation and text structures (discourse), and the meanings they convey (semantics).Of the courses taught by the Program, some are devoted to the theory and methods, while others deal with a variety of applied issues, such as language policy and language teaching.In these courses, students are exposed to data from a wide variety of languages and may do detailed work on a number of different languages and language families. Thorough training is given in linguistic theory and its application to a variety of empirical problems. Attention is also directed to research methods, the application of linguistics to language teaching, language planning and socio-linguistic issues. IMPORTANT NOTE:Due to structural changes in the undergraduate program rules in 2012, the courses that make up the new 2012 majors may be different to the pre-2012 majors, and therefore some courses cannot be counted between majors. Students are advised to contact the CASS Student Office if they are unsure about their Majors. Learning outcomesGraduates within the Linguistics Major will have the knowledge and skills to:demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the structures found in all human languagesdemonstrate an understanding of how people use languages to communicate, and of the role of language in human societydescribe the most important sorts of variation found in human languagesmake in-depth analysis in

Students considering honours in mathematics with a major in Mathematical Modelling should take the courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling, along with any other mathematics HPC courses of interest. Students interested in further research in a quantitative discipline may also benefit from the analytical skills developed in this major. The courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling focus more on scientific computing. They are intended for students with both a strong interest in mathematics and computing. Students interested in doing honours in Computational Science should take the courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling. Students interested in further research in a discipline with a strong computational component, such as astronomy, can benefit from the technical skills developed in this major. The courses in Applied Mathematical Modelling are aimed at students interested in developing their skills in building and interpreting models. This includes students whose primary interest is in an application area, such as physics or economics, but wants a better understanding of the models used in their discipline. It also includes students who have more of a professional or vocational focus. Students may be interested in taking this particular grouping of courses with more qualitative courses that better help them communicate their analysis to a wider audience. Students should be aware of the need to complete the pre-requisites for the level 2000 and 3000 courses. In particular, note that some of the courses are HPC courses. Also, to undertake later year computer science courses it is generally required to undertake 12 units of 2000-level COMP courses.

Students considering honours in mathematics with a major in Mathematical Modelling should take the courses in Analytical Mathematical Modelling, along with any other mathematics HPC courses of interest. Students interested in further research in a quantitative discipline may also benefit from the analytical skills developed in this major. The courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling focus more on scientific computing. They are intended for students with both a strong interest in mathematics and computing. Students interested in doing honours in Computational Science should take the courses in Computational Mathematical Modelling. Students interested in further research in a discipline with a strong computational component, such as astronomy, can benefit from the technical skills developed in this major. The courses in Applied Mathematical Modelling are aimed at students interested in developing their skills in building and interpreting models. This includes students whose primary interest is in an application area, such as physics or economics, but wants a better understanding of the models used in their discipline. It also includes students who have more of a professional or vocational focus. Students may be interested in taking this particular grouping of courses with more qualitative courses that better help them communicate their analysis to a wider audience. Students should be aware of the need to complete the pre-requisites for the level 2000 and 3000 courses. In particular, note that some of the courses are HPC courses. Also, to undertake later year computer science courses it is generally required to undertake 12 units of 2000-level COMP courses. Students should seek further course advice from the academic convener of this Mathematical Modelling major. Relevant Degrees 30.  Bachelor of Languages (BLANG) \n31.  Bachelor of Science (BSC) \n32.

{"code": "PSYC-MAJ","versions": {"2014": {"description": "Psychology is the scientific study of how people behave, think and feel. It is a broad ranging discipline that spans topics including perceiving and thinking, the biological basis of behaviour, research methodology, child development, perception and cognition, social psychology and personality. Students taking the psychology major will gain an understanding of how to apply the scientific perspective to psychological phenomena in the laboratory and in the real world.Within the major there is flexibility to select courses to meet individual career objectives. The intention of the Psychology major is to ensure the acquisition of contemporary knowledge in psychological theory and evidence across core themes in psychological science.Learning Goals:Students who have completed the Psychology major will be able to: Explain major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology. Differentiate theoretical and empirical frameworks that have defined and shaped the field. Define key concepts that characterise psychology as a field of scientific inquiry as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines. Relate how social (eg environmental/cultural), and biological (genes, hormones) factors jointly shape human behavior. Apply basic research methods in psychology to investigate psychological questions and to research design, data analysis, and interpretation. Use critical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes. Identify relevant psychological mechanisms/issues and apply to real world or other contexts. Apply psychological principles to personal, social, and organisational issues. Critically analyse data and research, including methodology, results and conclusions. Articulate some of the central questions and issues in contemporary psychology. Critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in the popular media. Identify and critically evaluate appropriate disciplinary research sources Evaluate information from a statistical perspective drawing on basic statistical concepts.

The field of environment and sustainability provides multiple examples of complex, wicked problems important to humanity, including climate change, food and water security and ecological sustainability. Using quantitative modelling to help solve environmental problems requires an holistic understanding of environmental and Earth systems, supported by an appropriate level of mathematical training and skill. You will develop the necessary mathematical understanding for environmental quantification, including the knowledge of differential equations and vector calculus that are the foundation of most dynamical environmental modelling. The experience in spatial analysis and/or measurement of environmental data that is fundamental in environmental and Earth system science is also part of this major. Modelling applications are discussed in courses focused on the science of the environment (including weather, climate and climate change, surface hydrology and groundwater, biodiversity and landscape ecology, fire behaviour, and palaeo-environments).","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1. Demonstrate the applied mathematical skills necessary for environmental assessment, modelling and analysis.\n2. Understand the importance and implications of quantifying uncertainty in environmental assessment, modelling and analysis, particularly in risk management.\n3. Apply this knowledge and associated skills to a range of different environmental systems and problems, including identifying appropriate modelling approaches and adequate data to address specific issues, and critically evaluating model predictions. \n4. Write scientific reports and communicate efficiently with university staff, peer students and the wider community on aspects of quantitative environmental modelling and its applications.\n5.

Building on a solid foundation of traditional mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge, the Major then focusses on the principles underlying the provision of thermal energy services, on the one hand, and electrical energy, on the other hand. By studying both, students learn that energy forms can be converted into another, and thus will develop the analytical skills that will permit them to select the most appropriate technology, or to combine several of them to meet an energy demand with high performance and low cost. The latter should include not only economic, but also environmental and social considerations. The Major also gives students a broad context of the available energy resources and energy technologies, both conventional and new. Students will gain technical specialisation in the two main areas of solar energy, thermal and photovoltaic. Graduates should be able to critically analyse and design solar thermal and solar photovoltaic energy systems, and combine both as required to provide energy solutions.

{"code": "SCOM-MAJ","versions": {"2014": {"description": "The Science Communication major aims to complement studies in the traditional science disciplines and to provide a solid foundation for professional science communication careers.The compulsory courses provide training in the presentation and writing of science for diverse audiences, analysis of science and technology issues in the context of the wider community, and research methods for investigating public perceptions of science.This major is a valuable adjunct for students wishing to enter scientific careers, because it enhances the communication skills and social awareness that are increasingly desired by science employers. These skills will strengthen your ability to: Successfully apply for funding for your research, communicate aspects of your research with members of the public and your peers, research and understand public attitudes to your science, particularly in the context of ethical controversy and risk, communicate and apply your scientific knowledge to practical situations in socially appropriate ways, speak confidently at science conferences, talk to the media about your work,and advise governments on science policy issues such as technological development, healthy living and environmental sustainability.This major is also an excellent foundation for students interested in pursuing careers as professional science communicators. If you have ever dreamt of: making science exhibits for Questacon, presenting television or radio shows about science, becoming a science journalist, rethinking the way science is taught in schools, researching the ways that movies, novels and comics have shaped public attitudes to science, or campaigning for change on science-related issues such as climate change, nuclear power and animal ethics,then this major is for you.","learning_outcomes": "Students who complete the Science Communication major will be able to: \n1. Recognise that \u2018science\u2019 has many meanings in society, including: bodies of knowledge, distinct sets of practices and methods, political and economic institutions, and, moreover, a human endeavour shaped by culture and context.\n2. Communicate science in accessible and appropriate ways with diverse communication partners.\n3. Use a range of means, media, and technologies to communicate science.\n4. Develop strategies to communicate complex and/or controversial science with stakeholders and different sectors of the public.\n5. Evaluate and critique the techniques and models used to communicate science.\n6. Appraise the interaction of interests, contexts and people shaping science as process, practice, discourse and industry in the modern world.\n7. Investigate diverse public attitudes to science and perceptions of science and the influences on these.\n8. Value the promotion of science communication to build democratic and ethical involvement in science discussions and decision-making.\n9. Comprehend shifts in the disciplinary development of science communication and how these can inform current science communication practice.\n10. Critically assess and use scientific and social science primary and secondary sources.\n11. Undertake science communication research drawing on a range of methods such as interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, and content analyses.\n12. Work collaboratively and independently on science communication research projects and activities.\n13. Model the inquiry and research values of science in their professional conduct.\n14. Cultivate a professional communication profile to advance their career. \n Additional InformationAdvice to StudentsWhat 1st year courses should you enrol in? SCOM1001 and ENVS1003. In addition to the six compulsory courses, the Science Communication major must include 12 units of additional courses, for which there are several options to choose from. Students are encouraged to investigate each additional option and to follow their professional and intellectual interests when making a decision. Students who are considering a future as a professional science communicator or science communication researcher are encouraged to choose SCOM3003 Special Topics in Science Communication to make up 6 or 12 additional units. This course allows students to devise their own project topic, which can have a focus on research, theory or practice. The flexibility of this course allows the greatest scope for extending your science communication expertise. Students who prefer the more rigid structure of coursework are encouraged to choose one of the discipline specific additional courses (BIOL3191, ENVS3007, ENVS3028, or SCNC3200) or to consider a Masters level SCOM course. Students who are undertaking another 3000 level science course that they believe comprises aspects that are relevant to science communication are invited to discuss their situation with the Undergraduate Convener. It is possible for the Convener to approve the inclusion of such a course within a student's Science Communication major sequence. Other course options may be considered with permission of the major convener. Students should seek further course advice from the academic convener of this Science Communication major.

Students in the Southeast Asian Studies major at ANU have access to a wide range of scholars and courses on language, history, cultures, and politics in the region. By completing coursework as prescribed by the major, students will gain a deeper understanding of regional issues, such as power, globalization, ethnicity and gender, as well as processes and issues specific to their country or area of interest. These can include religious systems, economic networks and cross-cultural contact. Current major strengths are in Burmese, Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese studies, and some of our staff also support work relating to other ethnic nationality and trans-border issues. In addition to developing a critical, analytical understanding of Southeast Asia, past and present, students gain significant knowledge and skills which will boost their qualifications for finding employment, or alternatively, further study for a higher degree program. The Southeast Asian studies major is designed to complement the Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese language majors, and the Burmese and Tetum language minors, though knowledge of these languages is not required for courses in the Southeast Asian studies major.","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: 1.

It also analyses the ways in which people experience and order social life. The discipline draws on diverse theoretical perspectives and research methods. Sociologists study a wide range of contemporary issues, including inequality and power, global environmental change and risk, embodiment and health, crime and surveillance, culture and identity, and citizenship and politics.By studying sociology, students learn how individuals and groups influence and are influenced by their social world.

Sociology can prepare students to participate in wider intellectual debates about social issues, problems and injustices.

Spanish is a major international language with more than 400 million speakers. It is the third most spoken language in the world (after Mandarin Chinese and English) and the national language of 22 countries (Spain and most of Central and South America, as well as Equatorial Guinea in Africa). It is also an official language of the European Union and a major second language in the United States. A great number of people all over the world learn it as a foreign language. Spanish shares with English a common Indo-European origin, and is relatively accessible to English speakers. Studying Spanish as a major can have multiple cultural and linguistic benefits, beyond the immediate learning of language and culture.Students beginning this major at introductory level follow a different pathway to complete the major. Language level placement tests are held prior to commencement. Students are advised to check prerequisites carefully and plan their major accordingly.

The Sustainability Studies major builds the fundamental understandings and skills necessary to develop research projects that effectively address complex problems of environment and sustainable development. It focuses on a core set of research skills- and design-based courses, with key choices in areas of quantitative, qualitative and spatial approaches. The skills developed in these courses are extended and applied in a wide range of research and policy relevant courses. This is a 'hands-on' major, with many opportunities to conduct small-scale research built into its components.The major is intended to complement more topic-related minors (e.g. Soil and Land Management, Climate Science and Policy, Environmental Policy) by developing and strengthening broad-based research skills and embedding them in an understanding of the role of research in addressing complex sustainability issues. Its completion at the appropriate level is good preparation for fourth-year Honours, and is recommended for students considering a sustainability-related career or research higher degree.","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1.

With the rise of digital technologies we are living in a society transformed by networks of data and intelligent machines. Technological change has profound effects on the structure and experience of social life and social relations, promoting widespread changes in identity, knowledge, work, health, relationships, communication, economics and politics. This major gives students the tools to understand and analyse the social and cultural drivers and impacts of technological change. It also enables students to develop skills in cutting-edge digital methods and to use these to conduct online social research, including research that addresses audiences beyond the university.Technology, Networks and Society adopts a primarily sociological perspective to analyse the social impact of technological change. It explores central sociological concerns such as social inequalities and stratification, identity and embodiment, social movements, social change, production and consumption and the nature of power, all in the context of technological transformation. However, it is an interdisciplinary major, drawing on insights from communication and media studies, cultural studies, science and technology studies, economics, geography and political science.","learning_outcomes": "Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: \n1. explain the relationship between technology and society from a sociological perspective;\n2. analyse the social drivers and impacts of technology, especially digital technologies, employing a range of theoretical frameworks;\n3. use a range of digital and web-based social research methods;\n4. carry out independent research on topics related to Technology, Networks and Society; and\n5. reflect on and discuss the impact of technology on sociological and social scientific knowledge and research, as well as on social relations and practices more broadly.\n Relevant Degrees 6.
