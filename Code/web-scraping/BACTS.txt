student you must always be enrolled full-time in 24 units each semester. When you enrol for the first time you will study ‘1000-level’ 
courses. These courses have ‘1’ as the first number in their course 
code, such as BUSN1001.Please also note that:You need to enrol in courses for both First Semester and Second Semester. In your first year, you cannot study more than four courses (24 units) per semester, eight for the year. You
 may take 1000-level courses later in your program.   But remember you 
can’t count more than ten 1000-level courses (60 units) in total towards
 your single degree.You can change your enrolment via ISIS in courses up until the Monday of Week 2.  When you enrol for the first time you will study ‘1000-level’ 
courses. These courses have ‘1’ as the first number in their course 
code, such as BUSN1001.Please also note that: You can use your electives to enrol in any courses that you like, provided you meet prerequisite requirements.Remember that you can choose up to 8 courses from another ANU College if you are undertaking the single Bachelor of Actuarial Studies degree. If you are in a double degree, your electives must be CBE courses.Don't forget the maximum number of 1000 level courses is 10
in single degree.
