 [4] "There are a variety of reasons for wanting to measure the costs and benefits from policy and other changes in economic activity. Governments want to measure the impact of their policy changes on society as a whole, while private agents focus on the impact they have on their own welfare and the welfare of those they care about. In markets subject to tax and other distortions market prices are not normally reliable measures of the social valuation of goods and services. Thus, they cannot be used to evaluate the social impact of policy and other changes. Instead, we derive shadow prices of goods and services to look through market distortions and measure social valuations. When changes in economic activity are evaluated using these shadow prices they provide measures of the social impact of policy and other changes. This course summarises the information provided by different welfare measures for single consumers and then looks at ways to aggregate them over consumers. In doing so, we examine ways to account for distributional effects in policy evaluation. Tax reform and the optimal provision of public goods are examined as applications of these shadow pricing rules. "

 [6] "Why are some countries richer than others? Why have some countries experienced growth miracles while others have experienced stagnation of even growth disasters? Within developing countries, what does it mean to be poor? How to combat poverty? What are the challenges that the poor in developing countries face and what can be done to improve their living standards? This course intends to teach students what we know and what we do not know about these important questions and will focus on teaching students tools in understanding them. The topics covered will include explanations on why countries develop differently, the effect of geography, institutions, foreign aid, corruption and differential savings rates on the large disparities across countries. Within countries we will examine the role of education, health migration and credit markets in poverty alleviation. The course will cover both theory and empirical evidence but focusing mainly on how to conduct empirical analysis in understanding these important economic development issues. "

[16] "In many - perhaps most - economic interactions, there is potential for strategic behaviour, a term, intended to focus on the interdependence of the adversaries' decisions and on their expectations about each other's behaviour (Schelling, 1960, The Strategy of Conflict).   Recognising and understanding such behaviour is an essential part of any economist's toolkit and this course is designed to enable just such recognition and understanding. Game theory has successfully been applied in a diverse range of fields, such as economics, political science, law, biology and computer science. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to strategic thinking and analysis through the basic techniques of game theory and to illustrate the range of its applications in economics and business and other areas.  While the level of the course will be introductory, and mathematical prerequisites are minimal, the presentation of the material will rely on precise logical arguments. "

The Course employs basic price theory - rational maximization, the law of demand, opportunity costs, and the idea that voluntary exchange allows resources to gravitate toward their highest- valued uses - to predict the consequences of legal rules: how they affect the behaviour of individuals and groups; and uses welfare economics to evaluate legal rules, especially their efficiency effects. Legal issues examined in the course include property rights, tort law, contract law, criminal law, law enforcement and punishment, litigation and settlement, principal-agent liability, and regulation v tort law as ways to control externalities.

Along the way we will consider how to include uncertainty in models and how to establish the existence of equilibria/optima and the comparative static properties of these predicted outcomes. "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
[32] "The course examines how individuals and firms make decisions by weighing up costs and benefits, and how the interaction of their decisions leads to market and social outcomes. The model of market supply and demand is employed to examine the effects of taxes, subsidies, and other government interventions in market activity. The implications of different market structures, including perfect competition and monopoly, are examined.  Public goods, externalities and common resources are key examples of cases in which private markets may yield socially sub-optimal outcomes.  Such cases are examined and the role of government policy in correcting for these is discussed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
[33] "Building upon material introduced in Microeconomics 1, this course aims to provide a solid understanding of basic microeconomic theory and the ability to apply those tools and ideas. Models describing the economic behaviour of individual decision-makers and the outcomes of markets are developed and applied to examine the welfare of market participants. Questions addressed include: What influences consumer demand decisions and how? How do firms decide on how much to produce and how much inputs to use? How do prices function to coordinate economic activity? What is meant by economic efficiency? When do markets fail to achieve efficient outcomes? Training in economic analysis is achieved via weekly tutorials that go over problem sets linked to material presented in lecture.

It identifies conditions under which market failures lead to environmental degradation or to the overexploitation of natural resources, and discusses economic policies that can counteract such market failures. Such policies include imposing taxes on certain economic activities, or allocating property rights that allow these activities to be undertaken.

The course seeks to develop an understanding of how governments actually use their 'policy space' in economic matters, and how they actually respond to expansions (or contractions) in that space."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
[43] "The theory of games helps us to understand situations where many agents interact in a strategic setting, where each agent's wellbeing depends on the behaviour of all agents. Game theory is a collection of analytic techniques widely used in many sciences. It has provided powerful tools that have successfully been applied in almost every field of economics and in many other disciplines, as well as creative and rigorous ways of developing new ideas and applications. The course covers a range of topics in advanced game theory, including current research topics."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
[44] "This course continues the discussion of microeconomic theory at the graduate level, as started in ECON4411 Microeconomic Theory A.  It will cover topics in microeconomic theory that extend beyond those covered in ECON4411. Topics might include applications of game theory, the economics of information, contract theory, and mechanism design. Students are expected to have the ability to follow rigorous abstract arguments, as used in the construction and analysis of mathematical models in economics. "
