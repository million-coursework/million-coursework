Students will develop an understanding of innovation processes and management within an engineering organizational environment. The organizational structure and the roles of science and technology in promoting an innovative environment, together with the associated risks and uncertainties, will be covered. The value, protection and management of Intellectual Property (IP) both in an organizational and legal context will also be considered. Students will be introduced to new engineering product development processes. The study of entrepreneurship will include start-up pathways, the establishment of a start-up company establishment and legal obligations.  Operational and finance plans in support of engineering start-up companies will also be considered."

This course will show students how to utilise systems analysis for effective design evaluation, and as a means for improving and optimising existing systems.  "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
[34] "This course is designed to mimic an industrial design problem as closely as practical in a university setting. Students are assigned to teams and given an ill-defined problem statement. From the problem statement, the students are responsible for developing the full set of requirements and key performance indicators to guide the design. The students then proceed through a systems design process including conceptual design, sub-system requirements, and quantitative tradeoff analyses, using the full range of engineering science and professional skills developed during the degree course. The course emphasises teamwork (both team leadership and membership), communication skills (formal and informal, written and oral), and team and personal management and a professional approach to engineering design."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
[35] "This course provides a comprehensive overview and advanced knowledge of modern mobile and wireless communication systems. Building on the prior knowledge on digital communications, students develop further understanding on the challenges and opportunities brought by the wireless medium in designing current and future wireless communication systems and networks. Topics include: overview of digital wireless communications, cellular concept; interference and traffic analysis for cellular networks; wireless fading channel modelling and characterization; modulation and detection performance over fading channels; equalization techniques; multi-carrier systems; spread spectrum techniques; receiver and transmitter diversity techniques; information theory of wireless channels; multiple antenna systems and space-time communications; and cooperative communications; 2G standards (e.g. GSM, CDMA), 3G standards and beyond."
