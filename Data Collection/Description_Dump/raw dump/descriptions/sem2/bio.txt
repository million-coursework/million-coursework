 [1] "This course examines in detail all aspects of the biology of the immune system, and uses this foundation to study the application of immunobiology to human disease. Topics will include the innate immune system, antigen processing and presentation, HLA, B and T lymphocytes, and how the immune system provides a coordinated response to viral, bacterial and helminthic pathogens. This biology will then be applied to the understanding of the pathogenesis of human autoimmunity, allergy, immunodeficiency and cancer, how such diseases can be diagnosed in the diagnostic pathology laboratory, and the theoretical basis of new treatment strategies. Finally, the course will cover research methods including animal models that prepare for future research into human immunological disease, aided by close liaison with, and presentations by, leaders in immunological research at ANU. Practical demonstrations in flow cytometry will be complemented by small group tutorials examining specific topics in immunobiology and analysis of the latest publications in the field."                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 [2] "The course will describe how ecological factors play an important role in animal health.  For example the gain and loss of strains from a host, within host population dynamics, e.g. competition, and among host dynamics, e.g. transmission.  Transmission will be examined in the light of many recent studies looking at how social networks are important determinants of disease transmission in a population.  Many of these questions will be addressed looking at individual bacterial species and a variety of hosts, both human and animal."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 [3] "Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing scientific discipline at the interface of genomics and computer science that has two distinct but overlapping aspects: the development of computer infrastructure (eg. algorithm, programs, databases) and their use to analyse a wide variety of biological data. Among these data, genes, transcripts and epigenetic variants play a central role. Their rapid and large-scale acquisition in today's genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other -omics projects poses the major challenge of modern biology. The large-scale and genome-wide analysis of these data is often referred to as 'functional genomics' and relies on advances in bioinformatics and high throughput technologies such as 3rd generation sequencing.This course provides an introduction to the key methods and technologies of bioinformatics and functional genomics, the fastest growing fields of biology and perhaps science. As computer literacy is central, the course will include a short section on computer programming using the Python programming language. Topics covered will include sequence comparison techniques, genome databases searches, population and comparative genomics, sequencing techniques, genome evolution."

Students will examine the milestone research studies that identified the basic principles and processes in evolutionary change, and the most recent experimental and genetic tools to test hypotheses concerning the evolution of life."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
[15] "This course deals with macroevolution, macroecology and biogeography - patterns of biodiversity at large spatial and temporal scales, and the processes that have generated these patterns. Surprisingly, there are many fundamental questions about biodiversity that remain poorly answered. For example, why are there so many species in the tropics? Did the extinction of dinosaurs pave the way for the rise of mammals? What causes one species to diverge into two? Equally surprisingly to many people, it is possible to test big-picture questions like these using a set of basic logical principles and analytical tools, and an ever-expanding database of molecular, geographic and ecological information on the world's species. The aim of this course is not to present you with facts to memorize, but to equip you with the skills to ask interesting questions about biodiversity, and develop creative and elegant ways to answer them. The course is taught through lectures, workshops and two computer workshops which give you the chance to learn and apply some of the key analytical tools used in large-scale biodiversity analysis."                                                                                                                                         
[16] "This course will explore the ways biologists generate and assess evidence applying a variety of statistical techniques. The use of biological models from bacteria, plants and animals will be discussed, with their advantages and limitations. The value of different experimental approaches including hypothesis-driven research and large scale data generation, such as genome sequencing projects will be considered.  Quantitative reasoning and analysis will be introduced with examples of its application to biological problems.  Students will participate in practical exercises to develop and test hypotheses and then, as a group, compare and contrast the application of statistical approaches to interpret the data."

[20] "Marine ecosystems play a crucial role in the health and function of our planet - from tiny plankton that shape global patterns of carbon and sulphur cycling, to massive coral reefs that support enormous biodiversity and feed millions of people. Once thought to be indestructible and inexhaustible, we now know that such marine communities are fragile and easily disturbed. In this course we will use both old and new concepts in marine ecology to explore how healthy marine ecosystems can be conserved in the face of human harvesting, habitat modification and climate change. Taking a problem-based approach, this course will examine key issues facing marine ecosystems (e.g., climate change, overfishing, biodiversity loss, ecosystem phase shifts) through lectures, hands-on tutorials and assessments. Students will gain first-hand experience in the quantitative methods used to describe and assess approaches to marine conservation, as well as skills in science communication via novel assessment items such as the role-playing press conference and graphical abstract design."

[23] "A broad and multi-disciplinary approach to the complex and dynamic relationships between parasites and their hosts. This course offers an overview of the biological and epidemiological bases of important parasitic diseases and an understanding of the impact of parasitic diseases on endemic communities. It covers many disciplines while studying the life-cycles, ecology, physiology, biochemistry, immunology, pathology and molecular biology of the covered parasites. Both protozoan parasites (unicellular parasites) and parasitic helminths (parasitic worms) will be considered with emphasis on the most important parasites of humans. Studies include aspects of the host immune response to parasites; chronicity of infection and its significance; host pathology; evasion of host responses by parasites; diagnosis, vaccination; chemotherapy and drug resistance; genetic resistance to parasitic infection; relevance of parasitic infections to society. In-depth study of malaria and schistosomiasis, with focus on the pathology, immunology and chemotherapy of these most important human parasitic infections will be of particular importance."                                                                                                                             
[24] "This course is based on an integrative approach to how global climate change is affecting vegetation with a specific focus on the rise of dieback in plant communities. There is much controversy in the field regarding causes of dieback; however, various factors are implicated including carbon starvation, hydraulic failure, vulnerability to biotic stress and phenology and how these drivers interact with elevated atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. You will investigate the causes of dieback through four modules driven by key researchers and through exposure to disciplinary controversies around the significance, role, and interplay of these factors on plant health, adaptation and survival. The course has a weekend field trip to Kioloa to identify and classify plants based on systematics and to consider evidence of vegetation changes arising from climate change and environmental stressors. There are several pre-field trip practical which will include living and herbarium specimens for first-hand examples of the plant groups and their characteristics. This course will build students' understanding of plant function in relation to global climate change, field skills in identifying plants and their research analysis and proposal formulation skills. "
