 [1] "Rapid advances in plant and animal biochemistry over recent years have fundamentally changed fields of science ranging from medicine to agriculture and food security. This course will present these recent advances exploring both the specifics and commonalities that exist in biochemistry when comparing mammalian and plant systems. The medical biochemistry stream will cover topics such as cancer metabolism, personalised immunology, molecular mechanisms related to drug development, ion channel function and aspects of translational medicine.  In the plant stream, topics to be covered include plant disease, CO2 fixation, photosynthesis and climate change. Lectures will be presented from experts from both the John Curtin School of Medical Research and the Research School of Biology. This course offers an excellent opportunity for students to understand how biochemistry impacts everyday life, and expand their knowledge of biochemistry across a platform of diverse and important disciplines."

[10] "Ecology concerns the fundamental patterns and flows in natural biological systems. We consider how organisms interact with their physical environment and with each other to shape their individual attributes, patterns of population dynamics, distribution, diversity and abundance; and across scales of time and space, the patterns and processes of community assembly and ecosystem function. Why are some organisms found here, and not there? Why do plants and animals look and work like they do? What makes their populations large or small, or change in size? Why do some organisms co-exist together, and others not? Why is there so much diversity? In understanding these questions, we gain critical insight into how populations and communities have evolved, how energy and biomass flow through ecosystems, and how populations and communities respond to changes in their environment. These changes may result from natural disturbances such as changes in climate, through altered disease prevalence or competition, or from human modification of habitat, perhaps through overharvesting or species removal. "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[11] "The aim of evolutionary and behavioural ecology is to understand how an animal is adapted to its environment, such as how an animal's behaviour contributes to its survival or reproduction. In this course we consider the outcomes of natural selection on animal behaviour and function, and discuss how we test adaptive hypotheses. We will do this by focussing on key issues in behavioural ecology. Our lectures are organised into four modules: trade-offs between costs and benefits for survival and reproduction, the principles of animal communication, the evolution of cooperation, and the biology of sex. We consider such questions as: How do individuals balance the need to get food yet avoid predators? How are communication signals designed and what do they mean? What stops animals lying? Why is cooperation potentially beneficial yet its evolution is difficult to understand? When is it advantageous to produce sons versus daughters? Why are individuals choosy when selecting a mate? Why do males care for young in some species but not others?  These areas cover research topics of interest to the strong behavioural ecology group at ANU, and we will include our current research as well as that carried out worldwide. The overall aim of the course is to develop a logical approach that can be applied to understanding and testing any question in evolutionary biology."
[12] "This is an Honours Pathway Course that is normally taken at the same time as BIOL3131, and deals with carrying out research on the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Students will work in tutorial groups to develop hypotheses about behaviour that will be tested during a week-long field trip. Results are then presented in a poster at the course's conference; and in a report in the form of a scientific paper. The course emphasises the design and effective reporting of scientific research, and will expose students to all of the stages of carrying out and reporting original research."

[21] "This course equips biology students with skills in basic mathematics, statistics and computing in preparation for areas of biology which require quantitative data analysis.  Such skills are important for experimental design and for analysing and interpreting quantitative datasets arising from modern bioinformatics and biological modelling.  Topics covered include introductory calculus, linear algebra, probabilty and statistics, and elementary computer programming.  Examples will be given of quantitative problems arising in biological contexts.  Laboratory and/or field practicals may be used for data gathering.  This course also provides a pathway to 1000 level mathematics courses.  "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
[22] "Of the 20 major animal phyla, 19 consist of invertebrates, including many familiar animals such as insects and snails, and more unusual ones including vampire squids and sea cucumbers. This course examines the the small things that matter in the context of their evolution and systematics. It looks at the origin of life in the sea and the enormous diversification following terrestrialisation. The focus is on major radiations and key evolutionary innovations including the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry and the development of a mesoderm and complex organs, that have occurred in the transition from simple to complex organisms. A 3 day field trip will give students a solid grounding in the marine and terrestrial invertebrate fauna of south-eastern Australia and the microhabitats they occupy. The practical component of the course will teach students techniques of specimen preservation and the use of biological keys in species identification."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
[23] "Food crises, GMOs, loss of biodiversity, climate change and increased incidence of abiotic stress- these are hot topics, and all of them are intrinsically linked to plants. Modern plant science holds unprecedented opportunities to link processes at the genetic, molecular and physiological level to patterns at the crop or plantation level to address these important issues and ensure future food security. This multidisciplinary course exposes you to an exciting breadth of contemporary plant sciences so you can develop a synthetic understanding of this rapidly changing field. Links between genetics, molecular biology, anatomy and physiology will be made. You will develop skills in several techniques important in contemporary plant science. You will apply your newly honed plant science skills to a detective problem - an intensive research project diagnosing consequences of specific genetic mutations to plant growth and physiology. This research project gives students a taste of a real research environment."
