First we examine the gains from trade, the determinants of patterns of international trade and the effects of trade on income distribution, all in low-dimensional models.

A central theme is the inter-relationship between empirical macroeconomic outcomes and theoretical constructs for explaining or understanding these outcomes. These models can also be used to understand and re-invent macroeconomic policies. In this course we also aim to bring the themes in undergraduate macroeconomic studies closer to what is taught in graduate courses, and also closer to how macroeconomics is done in the best universities and policy institutions such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, Bank of England, the Reserve Banks of New Zealand and Australia."

Thus, a thorough understanding of the economic content of such models is not possible without a clear understanding of the mathematical concepts that underpin the modeling. Together with ECON4414 - Mathematical Techniques in Economics II, this course forms a two-semester sequence, which introduces students to a range of mathematical concepts and techniques that form the basis of advanced economic theory courses, such as the ones required of students enrolled in Honours, Masters and PhD programs. The introduced concepts and techniques will be derived from basic principles and assumptions as thoroughly as possible, and will be illustrated using standard applications from economics.  Due to the strong interdependence between the topics covered in the two courses, students are encouraged to take both courses as a sequence in the same year. "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[16] "The course will focus on Microeconomic theory as an approach to organizing economic ideas through modelling. This course will examine some basic components of economic theory concerning the allocation of scarce resources:individual non-strategic decision making by consumers and firms, Markets and General Equilibrium, Game Theory for extending the models of consumers and producers to strategic settings (with an emphasis on asymmetric information and mechanism design), and models of how decisions are made in non market settings through political institutions or within firms. Along the way we will consider how to include uncertainty in models and how to establish the existence of equilibria/optima and the comparative static properties of these predicted outcomes. "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
[17] "The course examines how individuals and firms make decisions by weighing up costs and benefits, and how the interaction of their decisions leads to market and social outcomes. The model of market supply and demand is employed to examine the effects of taxes, subsidies, and other government interventions in market activity. The implications of different market structures, including perfect competition and monopoly, are examined.  Public goods, externalities and common resources are key examples of cases in which private markets may yield socially sub-optimal outcomes.  Such cases are examined and the role of government policy in correcting for these is discussed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
[18] "Building upon material introduced in Microeconomics 1, this course aims to provide a solid understanding of basic microeconomic theory and the ability to apply those tools and ideas. Models describing the economic behaviour of individual decision-makers and the outcomes of markets are developed and applied to examine the welfare of market participants. Questions addressed include: What influences consumer demand decisions and how? How do firms decide on how much to produce and how much inputs to use? How do prices function to coordinate economic activity? What is meant by economic efficiency? When do markets fail to achieve efficient outcomes? Training in economic analysis is achieved via weekly tutorials that go over problem sets linked to material presented in lecture. Overall, the course takes an analytical approach emphasising rigorous logical reasoning and economic problem solving."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
[19] "Modern economics is a way of thinking that provides important insights into human behaviour and how the world works. The emphasis in Microeconomics 3 is on deepening students' understanding of the basic principles of microeconomics and learning how to use these principles to analyse real world problems and policy issues. The course builds upon the material covered in Microeconomics 1 and 2 by treating some of the concepts introduced in previous microeconomic courses with greater degree of formality. The course also covers more advanced tools of microeconomic theory and applications of the theory to a range of economic problems. Topics and techniques that are emphasized include: concepts and measurement of individual and aggregate consumer welfare, partial and general equilibrium efficiency analysis, choice under uncertainty and information economics."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
[20] "This course has two main objectives. One is to study the role played by banks in modern monetary economies and financial markets, including issues arising from bank regulation, the role of banks in financial intermediation, and the significance of bank behaviour in monetary policy. This includes analysis of monetary innovations through crypto-currencies such as \"bit-coin\", and the shadow banking systems that played a significant role in the Global Financial Crisis. The second objective is to study the operation of monetary policy generally, in large economies such as the USA, and in small open economies such as Australia."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
[21] "The foundations of economic theory are based on mathematical models. Thus, a thorough understanding of the economic content of such models is not possible without a clear understanding of the mathematical concepts that underpin the modeling. Together with ECON2127 - Mathematics for Economists B, this course forms a two-semester sequence, which introduces students to a range of mathematical concepts and techniques that form the basis of advanced economic theory courses, such as the ones required of students enrolled in Honours, Masters and PhD programs. The introduced concepts and techniques will be derived from basic principles and assumptions as thoroughly as possible, and will be illustrated using standard applications from economics."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
[22] "This course uses the basic tools of microeconomics to analyse the role of government and the rationale for and design of taxation and  expenditure policy. The topics to be covered include a review of basic microeconomics, welfare economics, cost-benefit analysis,  public goods,  externalities,  public choice, public expenditure programs (including education, health, pensions and welfare payments),  and taxation (including efficiency and equity issues, tax incidence, Australian tax policy, and fiscal federalism). By the end of the course students should have an appreciation of the principal forms of market failure that provide a justification for government intervention, be familiar with the main policy instruments used to mitigate market failures and the principles that guide their optimal use, but also understand the limitations of government intervention - for instance, understand how the presence of information problems both explains the forms that policy intervention take and imposes limits on what can be achieved by it. The course also covers topics on public choice and provides an alternative, more critical, view of government. The public choice perspective places more emphasis on modelling the political process and argues that this, like the market mechanism, has readily identifiable sources of failure. "

[28] "In many - perhaps most - economic, political, legal and social interactions, there is potential for strategic behaviour, a term, intended to focus on the interdependence of the adversaries' decisions and on their expectations about each other's behaviour. (Schelling, 1960, The Strategy of Conflict).   Recognising and understanding such behaviour is an essential part of any analyst's toolkit and this course is designed to enable just such recognition and understanding. Game theory has successfully been applied in a diverse range of fields, such as economics, political science, military analysis, law, biology and computer science.The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to strategic thinking and analysis through the basic techniques of game theory and to illustrate the range of its applications in almost all fields of social interaction.  While the level of the course will be introductory, and mathematical prerequisites are minimal, the presentation of the material will rely on precise logical arguments.  This course should be of interest to students from any part of the University. "
