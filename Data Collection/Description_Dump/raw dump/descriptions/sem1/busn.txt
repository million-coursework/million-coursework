"This is an intermediate course which examines the analysis of financial information presented in firms' financial reports. The course comprises three related sections: fundamental analysis; valuation; and, the application of fundamental analysis and valuation techniques to a variety of specific decisions. Fundamental analysis involves answering questions such as: how is the firm performing? how might the firm perform in the future? what risks does the firm face? In addressing these issues particular attention is paid to the impact of financial reporting choices on the relation between reported earnings and firms' underlying economic performance. Valuation describes the methods by which our expectations of firms' future performance may be converted to a present day value of the firm's assets, and the various financial claims on those assets. The final section of the course provides an introductory coverage to issues such as equity security analysis and credit analysis, with a strong emphasis on the use of financial statement data for these purposes."
