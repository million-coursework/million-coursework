## Conclusions drawn from Tom's interview with Kelvin Cui (Academic Program Officer at Fenner Hall)

### Chatbot vs Website

Chatbots are less structured than websites, and are more likely to confuse the users. Thus, a website would be more useful for the users than a chatbot.


### Programs and Courses

* Good current features: Gives a lot of information about courses. The flexible double degree builder is great. We should look to strive for the same when building our version.

* Good potential feature: The ability to search for programs, courses or majors in one go. This seems to be more of an implementation detail.

### Overloading

Not many students enquire about this. The feature to suggest overloaded timetables should thus not be a top proiority.

### Course Credits

No enquiries so far. There *may* be enquiries next semester. The ability to present partial schedules shoud not be a major priority either.

_Note from Manal_: The low number of questions on this topic could also be due to the fact that people generally talk about course credit transfer <i>before</i> they take admission. Secondly, this feature would be automatically supported if we are also catering to continuing students (which I think we are).

### Important factors when selecting courses

1. Difficulty of the course
2. Relevance to degree
3. Requirement for many majors/minors/specialisations

These factors should be given high relevance when building the recommendation system.

### Integrating ISIS and P&C 

It will be a good feature to have but is not necessary

### Others

There seem to be questions from students about fitting their remaining compulsory courses into as few semesters as possible so that they graduate early/on time.

This seems to be an obvious feature that will be implemented if there is support for continuing students in the chatbot/website.
